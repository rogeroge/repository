## Introduction

*As me might think (about complexity) - or it makes sense to me!*

Git

My stance here is to take a observer's view of complexity. Recognised as a 2nd order viewpoint it incorporates my role, bias, judgements and thinking about any situation alongside the manifest realities of the situation. As I discuss Complexity therefore I need to recognise the distinction between my own thoughts and the system characteristics that combine to lead to my understanding.

Being consistent in this thinking introduces Churchman's idea of humility in this piece. To be true to the stance of a 2nd order viewpoint I cannot, nor wish to claim that my explanation is "better than yours" but equally this allows me to argue that "neither is yours better than mine. We are led to a stalemate of no winners in the explanation of complexity as is immediately evident from the contested definitions and futile arguments over simple (simplistic) formulations on the topic (including I might add the venerable sources such as the Complexity Matrices and its derivatives popularised by Stacey etc).

The principle of humility is no better demonstrated than by the legendary Physicist Richard Feynman in his admission that 'he had no knowledge of what energy is' to quote from his Lectures in Physics:- 

> There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law—it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the conservation of energy. It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in the manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same. Since it is an abstract idea, we shall illustrate the meaning of it by an analogy ...
> 
>  It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is. We do not have a picture that energy comes in little blobs of a definite amount. It is not that way. However, there are formulas for calculating some numerical quantity, and when we add it all together it gives "28 *{the number used in the analogy}*"'—always the same number. It is an abstract thing in that it does not tell us the mechanism or the reasons for the various formulas. (Feynman)

If I abandon any stance that requires an objective assessment of the 'intrinsic superiority' of this explanation of Complexity the remaining criteria is whether it is useful, and use is context dependent and the the eye of the beholder (observer).

### A Method for Synthesis
The method of choice in analytical (reductionist) studies is the binary chop, as explained in [Hubbard's] How to Measure Anything it is the design of the experiment with a 50% chance of a positive which is the pinnacle of efficiency and the mechanism of discrimination in reductionist approaches.

The question is does something equally effective exist for assessments of the process of synthesis - in many situations we have the challenge of exponential discrimination (apartness) and combinatorial association (betweenness).

It seems the answer is probably no - as can be illustrated by the graph - imagine throwing a ball against the 'wall of understanding' - the nature of the [stable refuges] in the reductionist case is tolerant to slight misalignments [concave levels] in the synthesis case the [refuge] is largely intolerant to slight misalignments [convex levels]. It means in reductionism even a poor [chop] can be useful in synthesis a poor idea succumbs to an avalanche of dross. (I think we can all relate to a brain storming exercise which produces just junk ideas). We have the runaway proliferation of conjectures and the hard work of reascending the slope of practicality.

### Kinetics and Thermodynamics

Thermodynamics is scale free and has some 'variables' such as temperature and pressure which define state from an infinite number of alternatives and unconditional stability

Kinetics depends on scale and composition and produces some constraints that act like variables which define state from a limited number of alternatives and the conditions for stability. The meta- acts like the real equilibrium in the confines of the nice - specifically reversibility and the energy balance.

### Understanding Complexity

Before you go further it might be worth recognising that ideas around complexity are locked into an abstraction built around a common set of principles/behaviours and corresponding there is no absolutism - no unitary definition or categorical right or wrong as to what is complexity.

It is an odd situation and a platform for circular arguments (as evident in Pfläging) which just lead no-where no matter how vehemently asserted.

If you are interested Richard Feynman explains the analogous situation in our understanding of energy - a topic I think we all claim to understand 'as real'

"There is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in the manifold changes which nature undergoes. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same. It is an abstract thing in that it does not tell us the mechanism or the reasons for the various formulas". (Feynman - Lectures in Physics)
