### Dynamics Tetris and Models
Although there are innumerable frameworks and categorisations that deal with static or historical representations of the facets of systems  there are few that provide an idea of their dynamics. This is critical as a dynamic appreciation makes more demands on the mental processing by the observer and the model framing of the situation.

The Tetris metaphor (hat tip Espen) is an excellent example not only does the metaphor provide an insight into the confusion which is resolved but the recognition of a pattern, it also accumulates the additional pressure we feel when the working buffer of unmatched shapes builds up and our response times for clear thinking are compromised, it present a dynamic model of both the evolving situation and our mental processes, even panic, in response to these events. Our individual responses 

### Bayesian Thoughts and Surprise Tests

In the aftermath of Mike Lynch's death (the founder of Autonomy) there was the challenge of his controversial claim that "claimed that probabilities were not properties of the world" it was a piece of bravado which always got the attention of his audience and, presumably, helped to sell his software. Less famous, but equally thought provoking, is Geoff Elliott's "there is no such thing as a system" to challenge framing which thinks of systems as real.

A Bayesian paradox illustrates whether everything was Bayesian. 

“The question is,” says [Prof. James Alexander](https://dailysceptic.org/2024/08/25/why-did-the-bayesian-sink/), “is probability a property of reality or a property of our awareness of reality? In other words, is it objective, or subjective: is it to do with our minds, or not?”. In Systems Thinking the objective view is an ontological (real) understanding, the subjective view is the epistemic (observer dependent) understanding.

> Consider the following scenario.
> 
> “You will face a test one day next week,” the teacher tells you, “but I’m not telling you when it will be.”
> 
> You ponder when the test might occur. At this point, you know each day is as likely as the others: there are five days in the week, so each has a likelihood of a fifth or 20%.
> 
> Monday comes and goes; no test. Heading into class on Tuesday morning you know there are now four days remaining, so you recalculate: each remaining day has a quarter or 25% chance of being test day.
> 
> Again, the day passes without a test. Wednesday morning, with three possible test days remaining, you work out that each has a third or 33% chance of being it.
> 
> But it’s now Thursday and still no test. Has the teacher forgotten? With just two days remaining, you calculate each has a half or 50% likelihood.
> 
> But Thursday, too, passes without a test. Assuming the teacher was being truthful, you turn up to class on Friday, 100% certain that the test must occur today. Sure enough, the test appears.
> 
> Subjective probability does throw up some knotty logic problems, it would be fair to say. Let’s return to the test the teacher set for us and suppose that she stipulates it will be a _surprise_ test, i.e., we will not know on the day of the test that it is going to take place. This apparently innocuous stipulation messes with the logic of the probabilities in a weird way and [generates a paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexpected_hanging_paradox). To see why, note that such a surprise test _cannot_ occur on the Friday. This is because, once we get to the Friday, we are 100% certain the test will occur today (as it must happen at some point this week). Therefore the test would not be a surprise to us – and the teacher has stipulated that it _will be_ a surprise to us. Hence we deduce the teacher will not set it on the Friday.
> 
> Having ruled out the surprise test occurring on Friday, it seems we can continue the train of logic and rule out Thursday as well. For with Friday ruled out, when we now arrive at Thursday morning we will be certain that the test will occur today, as we have already established that it cannot occur on Friday. But this would mean that, again, it will not be a surprise to us, and since the teacher has stipulated it will be a surprise, we conclude that it cannot occur on Thursday either. ... etc


Playing logic word games for a moment, if the test is going to be a surprise it cannot be on Friday, if the challenge was re-phrased as the teacher threatens a random test next week the paradoxes around the date do not apply, and if the random pattern is repeated over a number of weeks retrospectively a view of a random test is objectively true. The use of the word 'surprise' changes the nature of the situation and our thinking about it, it essentially entrains an objective understanding with a subjective understanding.

In one sense then Mike Lynch is very likely to be right, that we are insufficiently precise in our use of words to allow a real situation to be 'contaminated' by sloppy thinking and thus become subjective. Equally Geoff Elliott is likely to be correct, there are no systems, because our thinking usually fails to differentiate the base elements of the situations and the observer conflation of purpose, properties and projections. The challenge posed by Prof Alexander - is it objective, or subjective - is a false dichotomy in Systems Thinking we, often unwittingly, combine both.
