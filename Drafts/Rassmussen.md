All models are abstractions that simplify reality to make sense of complexity. This model makes sense to me. 

(The depicted version is from Rydenfält, Ek and Larsson, 2013; the explanation below is based on Rasmussen, 1997 and Rasmussen & Cook, 2005).

Systems adapt and survive despite operating under constant pressure and near their limits. There are three critical boundaries for any system: the economic failure boundary (going out of business), the unacceptable workload boundary (people falling asleep from exhaustion), and the acceptable performance boundary (the minimum performance level required). Systems operate within these boundaries, constantly moving and adjusting.

Systems are complex and adaptive, responding to various pressures with both planned and unplanned changes. Adaptations happen on multiple time scales, from seconds to decades. Operators play a crucial role in monitoring, exploiting opportunities, estimating failure distance, reacting to threats, anticipating future conditions, and learning system behaviors. These activities are part of a continuous process.

Despite operating near failure, systems generally avoid accidents due to resilience and continuous adjustments. Systems drift towards accident boundaries due to economic and workload pressures but are pushed back by countermeasures like rules and safety campaigns.

Over time, successful operations beyond the safety margin lead to a shift in the margin itself, bringing it closer to the accident boundary and increasing the likelihood of accidents. This is termed "flirting with the margin."

In a competitive environment, the need for commercial success drives organizations to operate at the edge of accepted practices. Objectives can vary widely, from production targets to safety constraints, and when these objectives are translated through an organization, their interpretation can vary significantly based on the local context. Effective risk management involves making the boundaries of safe operation explicit and developing coping skills for these boundaries.

Rasmussen (1997) proposed identifying decision-makers, their objectives, and the information they have, as well as understanding how their interactions and side effects contribute to accidents. The goal is to ensure that safety boundaries are visible and understood, allowing for safer and more effective operations. This requires information about the actual state of operations and the competence of decision-makers. 

Performance data needs to be continuously monitored and adjustments made as needed. Decision-makers must be knowledgeable about the specific hazards in their work environment and capable of making informed risk management decisions.

What's your take-away from the boundary model?

I think the original is much better - the 'brownian motion' eclipse suggests a natural 'jitter' around the mean point - set in a human system by the tolerance of what is 'allowed'.  
  
No dynamic system can exist on a pinpoint - as is implied by the systems operating point.  
  
It also makes more sense in understanding the behaviours of the boundaries over time, the 'safe' boundaries of the safety system generally do not shift but the tolerances become relaxed (expanded). When 'what you can get away with' - which is the dynamic variable - crosses the boundary disasters happen.
