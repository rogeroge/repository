# Ignorance and Untruth
Writing this piece, what GK calls an Epilogue, has been a long time in gestation. Each 'false start' has produced a semblance of a very different structure and argument which, to me, suggests that it is a highly contested concept. Or being blunt it is a concept for which multiple different, even wrong, interpretations can be held.
Any critique is then a herculean task which for completeness needs to cover each and ever interpretation rather than the easier take of demonstrating that which is correct. Drucker popularised the Churchill maxim "***A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on***", the equivalent here "***the waste in progressing bad ideas far exceeds the benefits from any good ones***".
As is evident I am not a fan of the Stacey Matrix but to save us all time I will discuss my fundamental objection in its use, some warning signs of danger and then present an argument for its usefulness.
# The Map to Nowhere
I start with the central assumption that the matrix is some form of a map. Elsewhere I have seen others make the case that the matrix is NOT a classification device or is a phenomenological framework etc. In 'obvious' use, and in the many derivatives, few will have asked this question but have simply used it to position into the quadrants and definitions a selection of their issues and experiences. We need to investigate their purpose! 
> [!Critical Issue]
> The issue with the map is to question what is the scale? Does the proximity of the objects (i.e. experiences, situations, solutions) placed on it have any significance and how do I move from one place on the map to another. It is to ask the question what do I need to do more of, or less of, to intervene appropriately?

> [!Original Text Surrounding Figure 2.10]
> *What Figure 2.10 makes clear is this: it is only in situations close to certainty and agreement (area 1 in the diagram) that it is possible for the members and managers of an organisation to plan their future. Only when they are close to both certainty and agreement can they utilise a technically rational mode of decision-making and a monitoring form of control, the essential elements without which an organisation cannot be said to be following a planned path to a planned future. This indicates that planning is a decision-making/control process that can be applied only over a relatively short time span into the future.*
> *The picture is one in which strategies can be intentional and deliberate in conditions close to certainty and agreement, but there is no option but for them to be emergent when people operate far from certainty and agreement. If we are to understand the nature of strategic management in a manner that is at all realistic, then we are going to have to understand both intentional and emergent strategies and we are going to have to understand in much more depth the whole range of decision-making and control processes that produce them.*
> ### Close to certainty
> Close to certainty there are clear-cut links between causes and effects, and the consequences of actions can be forecast to a reasonably useful degree of accuracy.
> ### Far from certainty 
> However, when managers confront open-ended change far from certainty the situation is completely different in every respect. They are faced with actions and events past, present and future that have unknown long-term consequences. The key difficulty, then, is that of identifying what the problems and opportunities are. The prime difficulty is not that of finding answers, but identifying what questions to ask. The situation is ambiguous and the responses of managers are equivocal.

The original Stacey matrix labels the axes as close to certainty (as described above) and close to agreement. Whilst the certainty access might be interpreted as a matter of fact through the accumulation of evidence (the ontological view), this same certainty might be a proxy for the confidence that a group of people have over the interpretation of this evidence (an epistemic view). In short the certainty axis is a mix of unambiguous fact and collective opinion often described less charitably as groupthink. Clearly the agreement axis is epistemic and determined solely by the audience for the graph which perhaps should be part of a third dimension?
![[Media/Zimmerman - Regions version of Stacey Matrix.png]]
Zimmermann adopted the original Stacey matrix and consolidated the 'zone' labels - simple, complex etc - to the basic template then widely adopted by others. This step now begs the question - when we use the Stacey/Zimmermann matrix how do the transformations work? For example if we introduce a group of conformists, or ramp up the pressure to conform, do we move the properties of the situation from Complex to Complicated? It begs more questions than it answers - how much agreement tips the situation from Complex to Complicated, who needs to agree and more specifically what do the zones represent.
# Mapping the Situation or Mapping the Approach?
Zimmermann used the matrix in her consulting practice which usually was anchored in a context often with a common experience or cultural homogeneity (such as pressure group or work colleagues). In such an environment the comparison of situations and hence the agreement axis can be used as it is based on some ineffable shared experience or opinion. This is the situation when Zimmermann introduced the form of the Stacey Matrix by Larned.
![[Media/Larned Matrix.png]]
This use of the matrix is much closer to Stacey's original use where the framing and axes are used to position different techniques to intervene rather than a commentary on the underlying situation. In short it demands an assessment of the characteristics of the situation against some ineffable yardstick - for example situation A is more complex than situation B (and the follow-up that tool A worked in situation A but will be ineffective in situation B). We are aligning a set on tangible approaches to the characteristics of our opinion of the situation.
It is interesting to observe GK's comment on the frequency with which the matrix is used as a diagonal (as with Larned above). This represent a collapse of the axes in which agreement is actually operates as a synonym for certainty rather than an orthogonal dimension. The much vaunted matrix then becomes a simple ordered list!
# A Different Point of View!
The first question of ***what do the axes represent (an observer dependent ranking)*** needs to be followed up with the second question of ***what do the zones - simple, complex etc - represent***. In seeing the Stacey Matrix as a product of an observer's view the 'zones' are also observer dependent, there is no absolute definition of Complexity simply a description that each observer uses relatively (and differently). It leads to frightening statements such as "***Complexity is not an intrinsic property of any specific situation***" but is ***rather a consequence of the observer's view of the situation***. I anticipate this will created many howls of anguish "surely the rush hour traffic in London is complex" etc.
### Complexity in the Eye of the Beholder?
This is not a new understanding but has been the settled conclusion of deep thinkers on Complexity in general and Hierarchical Theory in particular. John Warfield suggests that ***if complexity is understood in retrospect i.e. learned then it is a phenomenon of the observer not the observed***
The properties associated with Complexity, such as emergence, were first discussed by Lewes in 1875 who stated "***the emergent is unlike its components insofar as these are incommensurable, and cannot be reduced to their sum or their difference***". More recently [Tim Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_F._H._Allen) positions emergence not as a property of a complex system but as "***an 'explainer in retrospect' used by an observer to render the situation as simple***"
The cognitive and perceptual basis of complexity were central to the two definitions of complexity given by Warfield \[1974, 2002\]. An early definition offered: "***Complexity is a property of a system, occasioned by a variety of factors germane to the system, which complicate human perception of the system and consequently make its understanding difficult***" \[Warfield, 1974: 1-1\].  Warfield's evolved definition provided the following: "***Complexity is that sensation experienced in the human mind when, in observing or considering a system, frustration arises from lack of comprehension of what is being explored***" \[Warfield, 2002: 20\].

### The Eye of Cynefin
![[Media/Cynefin - latest 2022.jpg]]
The most evident clue to the observer dependent nature of the Stacey Matrix (and other similar classification approaches) comes from the more recent version of the Cynefin Framework with the middle area labelled in 2022 as *confused* (also discussed in terms of liminality etc). This 'middle ground' is used as the transition zone for the migration from one zone to another. Cynefin is interesting in that it does away with the linear boundaries between the various zones - simple to complicated etc - but retains the delusion that there is some adjacency characterised by some vector (measured by the missing axes).
> [!Sidebar discussion]
> Incidentally there is a treatise on the logic of language that could be written about interventions in a systems. A chaotic system is recognised as such independently of any observer, whilst a complex system can be seen as Complex by some observers and Simple by others. Correspondingly a system transition from chaotic to any other state can only be achieved by a change or behaviour whereas transitions between the other states can either be behaviour induced or observer induced. A chaotic system has no observable regularities, the other states have regularities that can be observed differently by different observers.  

***When we are talking about making systems more or less Complex our perspective is more likely to be how we think about the situation not about the specifics of the concrete reality. That is complexity is not in the world but in the head.***
### The Eye of the Beholder
A better approach to the study of Complexity would be to first study some of the work of Hierarchy Theory of which Tim Allen makes the point that it is a ***Theory of Observation*** and, usefully, that the choice of scale, level and agent can introduce or resolve apparent complexity.

> We watch an ant make his laborious way across a wind- and wave-molded beach. He moves ahead, angles to the right to ease his climb up a steep dune let, detours around a pebble, stops for a moment to exchange information with a compatriot. Thus he makes his weaving, halting way back to his home. So as not to anthropomorphize about his purposes, I sketch the path on a piece of paper. It is a sequence of irregular, angular segments not quite a random walk, for it has an underlying sense of direction, of aiming toward a goal. 
> I show the unlabelled sketch to a friend. Whose path is it? An expert skier, perhaps, slaloming down a steep and somewhat rocky slope. Or a sloop, beating upwind in a channel dotted with islands or shoals. Perhaps it is a path in a more abstract space: the course of search of a student seeking the proof of a theorem in geometry. 
> Whoever made the path, and in whatever space, why is it not straight; why does it not aim directly from its starting point to its goal? In the case of the ant (and for that matter the others) we know the answer. He has a general sense of where home lies, but he cannot foresee all the obstacles between. He must adapt his course repeatedly to the difficulties he encounters and often detour uncrossable barriers. His horizons are very close, so that he deals with each obstacle as he comes to it; he probes for ways around or over it, without much thought for future obstacles. It is easy to trap him into deep detours. Viewed as a geometric figure, the ant's path is irregular, complex, hard to describe. ***But its complexity is really a complexity in the surface of the beach, not a complexity in the ant***. 
> On that same beach another small creature with a home at the same place as the ant might well follow a very similar path
# You know you are in trouble when...
I will close this section, specifically on the use of the Matrix, by an observation on the further refinements extending the use beyond that first proposed by Stacey - namely as a listing and classification yardstick for managerial approaches.
The history of the understanding of planetary motion is widely used in science to demonstrate what goes wrong when the consensus view is wrong and challenged by an outsider I will use it here to illustrate the dangers of using the wrong model 
![[Media/Ptolomy solar system.png]]
As evidence was accumulated which showed the inadequacy of the Ptolemaic view of the planets in order to support the popular paradigm, and dismiss Copernicus' ideas, a set of planetary epicycles were used to adorn the basic model. This compensation for the inadequacies of the original idea became more complex and convoluted and soon overwhelms the simplicity of the original idea it attempts to uphold. The kludges became a complex distraction which in hindsight prevented and delayed progress towards a superior explanation.
# Usefulness
> [!Abiding Principle]
> “**Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful**. “In George E.P. Box and Norman R. Draper, Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces (1987), 74

We all live in a world of our own models and beliefs so it is churlish to be critical of the structure by which people think. The Stacey Matrix and derivatives, however wrong may nonetheless be useful to those who employ it. In support of the Matrix, or any other approach, I wish to develop the distinction between thinking in the concrete and thinking in the abstract. The abstract world, of which there are many, gives free vein to creativity and imagination, literally anything is possible. The real world, in which we live, is concrete and there is only one.

In discussing this difference I return to the world of maps and the iconic London Tube system map which became the pioneer in the common depiction of public transport systems around the world.

# The London Underground Map
The original map of the London Underground system illustrated the network of stations primarily as they were positioned geographically and was essentially a concrete or ontological view of the situation.
![[Media/LUL Map 1908.jpg]]
This view was refined by Harry Beck in what became an iconic image of the London network and was adopted as a design classic by other transport systems. In Beck's representation he exchanged a design based upon where the stations were situated geographically to focus instead on the relationship of the stations to each other on the network, consequentially the distances between stations were fixed (irrespective of distance) and the proximity of any two stations together with any interchanges were displayed linked to their intervening stations.
![[Media/LUL Harry Beck 1933.jpg]]
The abstraction afforded by Beck's map also allowed a cartographic 'clean-up' fixing the tube lines as either vertical/horizontal or at the diagonal with stations equally spaced along their lines. This made the map much easier the understand and remember. The popularity and longevity of the Beck map is testament to the ease of use and utility of the (geographically wrong) map.
# The Truth in False Perspectives
Despite the usefulness of the abstract (Beck) representation it contains many anomalies and falsifications which only become relevant outside of the immediate transport network, if your interests are only on the 'tube' part of the journey it is perfectly adequate. If however you want to look at the whole picture, ie go from A to B in London these distortion can be both significant and important. For example how long will it take? - depends on the walking time between destination and station.
> [!Deeper Study]
> For any '[anoraks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorak_(slang))' amongst you there are a number of websites that detail the anomalies and inconsistencies in the map.
> [Big Lies on the Tube Map](https://londonist.com/london/transport/5-big-lies-on-the-tube-map)

> [Geographically Accurate Tube Map](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/224813/response/560395/attach/3/London%20Connections%20Map.pdf)

Whether these false perspectives and distorted scales in the real world are significant depends on the interests and focus of the observer - their purpose and the aspects of the world in which they are interested.
# Discussing Complexity in the Stacey Matrix
The first use of the Matrix emerged from a classification of examples to amplify the commonality of different examples of 'complexity'. This was an attempt to recognise the patterns of common behaviours even if there was no visible common cause, it was to emphasise the common relationships rather than the common components. It's first use was designed to identify patterns of relationships not to catalogue parts.
However the use of the Stacey Matrix makes this intention backfire. By reifying complexity as a real thing we are led down a cull-de-sac in thinking, in Complexity we should be thinking about common abstractions expressed as relationships and manifest as behaviours, we should not be thinking about complexity as a real thing. Complexity is not an immutable characteristic of the system components but is an abstract relationship manifest by the particular structural relationship and structural history of the parts.
> " ***... the idea of 'system' is an abstraction which we reify and anthropomorphize, forgetting that it is simply a conceptual device to think about what we are producing 'as if' it were a system." (Ralph Stacey) - ==which I would extend to include Complexity==***
# 101 Uses of the Stacey Matrix?
The Stacey Matrix can be safely employed as an abstract device valuable in ranking initiatives, choosing approaches or simply just as a talking stick which allows potential change to be discussed openly. However this observer dependent abstract use is not and should not be confused with a representation of the real world or the real entities it contains.

# Beware The Dangers of Falsehoods
Before we offer an opinion on the use of the Stacey Matrix or its derivatives it is tempting to ask why do they persist, in the Latin expression ***cui bono***? 
- If it releases the interests, potential and energies of those impacted by situations they are struggling to comprehend (and are deemed Complex), then well and good.
- If it becomes a platform for a consulting opportunity and a platform for dubious concepts, then I am not so sure and it reminds me of a sketch from [Yes Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister)
> [!Yes Minister Sketch]
> **Sir Humphrey:** _Unfortunately, although the answer was indeed clear, simple, and straightforward, there is some difficulty in justifiably assigning to it the fourth of the epithets you applied to the statement, inasmuch as the precise correlation between the information you communicated and the facts, insofar as they can be determined and demonstrated, is such as to cause epistemological problems, of sufficient magnitude as to lay upon the logical and semantic resources of the English language a heavier burden than they can reasonably be expected to bear._
