  This is why Koestler rejected Poincaré’s explanation as ‘mechanistic’. Nothing guides one gnat to fly towards another, nothing causes one gas-molecule to move nearer to another – and nothing prevents their random dancing from falling into madness. Creativity requires more than the mere automatic mixing of ideas. Even an unguided bisociation of matrices is not enough:
> 	 [The] rebellion against constraints which are necessary to maintain the order and discipline of conventional thought, but an impediment to the creative leap, is symptomatic both of the  genius and the crank; what distinguishes them is the intuitive guidance which only the former enjoys.
> As for how this intuitive guidance works, Koestler recognized the need  for a detailed explanation, of which (as he was well aware) he could  provide only the sketchiest outline. Discussing various scientific discoveries, for example, he said:
> 	 Some writers identify the creative act in its entirety with the unearthing of hidden analogies.... But where does the hidden likeness hide, and how is it found?... [In most truly original acts of discovery the analogy] was not ‘hidden’ anywhere; it was ‘created’ by the imagination.... ‘Similarity’ is not a thing offered on a plate [but] a relation established in the mind by a process of selective emphasis.... Even such a seemingly simple process as recognising the similarity between two letters ‘a’ written by different hands, involves processes of abstraction and generalization in the nervous system which are largely unexplained.... The real achievement [in many scientific discoveries] is ‘seeing an analogy where no one saw one before.’

## Linking to the Physical

When we think about things we have an imbalance. We have many more conceptualisation of the situation which we use to think about an actuality/single manifest reality

> no of conceptualisations >> no of manifestations/actualities

We can view this as a balance between the widely expanding zone of possibilities and the tightly constrained target of reality, with any practicable insights for change limited to the union of the conceptual and the concrete reality.

We should use Brands [shearing pace of change] to show the manifest target as a series on concentric circles (target) and the pace/ease of change

From slow to fast ..

- assemblies
- environment
- sub-assemblies (ie enviornment shaped)
- configurations aka structure

### Cone or conjecture and target of tangibility

Why systems thinking is not philosophy, problem of introducing errors

Cone of conjecture - futures, target is now, possibilities collapsed, constraints active

### Limits to Innovation
>Throughout my career I have seen the personal and institutional miasma grow like a fog to even deny the opportunity given to the individuals and institutions themselves.
> In my first job as a new graduate I was put on the team for the new hires with a team of senior managers. The 'team' then proceeded to outline the requirements for new graduates which progressively eliminated each one of them as suitable candidates.
> Later in my career, in Pharma R&D, I struggled to get 'luck' on the whiteboard of why they were successful. They all believed in the myth of their own method as being the single determinant of success.
> Then I worked on a benefits assessment 'methodology' which strangled all new development work.
> Finally I worked with a Quality department on a document management system which unreasonably demanded 100% test coverage before a system went live.
> And now I am faced with "Precautionary Principle" which simply does not allow any trade-off or benefits assessment just a religious denial of anything different. 
> So the 'rot' is just not for the genius level but pervades our everyday activities.
