Vickers’ observation about the way individuals make sense of their world is described through the idea that he calls the Appreciative Cycle. The Appreciative cycle begins with the interests and concerns that each individual might possess. Individual interests and concerns, he says, are for the most part subjective and shaped by a person’s appreciative settings, which are their values, beliefs, standards and experiences. These interests and concerns are then internalized and represented in the form of a ‘situation’ (Vickers, 1983).

Next, individuals make what he calls ‘reality judgements’ where they select perceived ‘facts’ relevant to the current situation. These ‘facts’ are considered to be subjective and shaped by an individual’s appreciative settings. In other words, a reality judgement helps an individual to appreciate ‘what is the case’ (Vickers, 1983) for the current situation. 

Once a reality judgement has been made, an individual then considers ‘what ought’ to be the case (Vickers, 1983) for the given situation; they consider ‘facts’ relevant to an ideal state on the basis of their appreciative settings. Vickers calls this the making of a value judgement. Value judgements are based on an individual’s values, norms, standards and beliefs, which he called ‘appreciative  settings’.

Checkland (2005) suggests that, ‘...the standards, models and values in the model are never absolute; able to survive unchanged over a long period of time. In fact, they are the product of the previous history of this process’ to emphasize that an individual’s appreciative settings change continuously with different cycles of appreciation.

The third aspect of the appreciative process is an action judgement where the practical feasibility of the aforementioned hypothetical relationships is investigated. ‘The action judgment is involved in answering any question of the form “what shall I do about it?” when “it” has been defined by judgements of reality and value’ (Vickers, 1970, p. 150). The results of an action judgement are the selected relationships that are  deemed significant enough to maintain/modify/delete in the current real-world situation. These relationships were selected from amongst the hypothetical relationships that followed the making of reality and value judgements. ‘Vickers’ appreciative settings may in principle be changed by every act of appreciating’ (Checkland and Davies, 1986). In other words, as a result of each single cycle of appreciation, the individual’s appreciative settings might be modified (Stowell and Cooray, 2006), which would change the manner in which she or he makes judgements in the next appreciative cycle.

Vickers' concept of Appreciation gives explicit recognition to something of which we are all aware as we attempt to negotiate our daily lives - that is to say that much of our behaviour is experienced as 'muddling through' rather than pursuit of goals. Vickers regarded an Appreciative system as one that is constantly revised or confirmed by three needs; 'First it should correspond with reality sufficiently to guide action. Second, it should be sufficiently shared by our fellows to mediate communication and Third, it should be sufficiently acceptable to ourselves to make life bearable' (Vickers, 1983a, p. 55).

The term “appreciative” has two meanings. First, as Geoffrey Vickers wrote, “appreciative systems” are a culture’s system of values, beliefs, and expectations that guide perception and action. The appreciative system “resides not in a particular set of images, but in a readiness to see and value and respond to its situation in a certain way.” In Vickers’ scheme, a culture’s valuing processes 
are self-reinforcing systems that generate anticipation, expectation, and perception, and therefore hasten the anticipated results. 

## SSM

The 'soft' tradition regards system models as models relevant to arguing about the world, not models of the world; this leads to 'learning' replacing 'optimizing' or 'satisficing'; this tradition talks the language of 'issues' and accommodations' rather than 'solutions' (Checkland 1985a: 765).

it is the ever changing outcome of a social process in which human beings continually negotiate and renegotiate, and so construct with others their perception and interpretations of the world outside themselves and the rules for coping with it. These rules are never fixed once and for all (Checkland 1988b: 246).

Thus, SSM does not make any ontological statements about a systemic reality. Instead it uses systemic models as epistemological devices to inquire and learn about the different perceptions of reality, being conscious of that these models "are not models of real-world activity, they are models relevant to debating it" (Checkland 1988b: 244).

Thus, in SSM social reality is assumed to be different from the reality that is researched in the natural sciences. According to Checkland (1981: 285), it is "reasonable to assume that there is an unchanging physical, chemical, and biological world 'out there' and that we can find out about it by using the method of the natural sciences".

However, concerning social reality Checkland (1981: 285) states that "no once-and-for-all substantive account of social reality is possible because there is no social reality to set alongside what appear to be the well-tested physical regularities of the universe."

Instead, he continues, since our knowledge cannot hope to achieve the kind of certainty as in the natural sciences "the way one finds out about it may in principle be reasonable stable; hence the
importance of methodology rather than findings, of process rather than content (Checkland 1981:285)".

Real creativity, in contrast to phantasy [fantasy], is immediately confronted with the constraints generated by the means, the resources, the material support of creative expressions (Hoebeke 1988: 337).

The purpose of the systems modelling phase in SSM is not to describe what the content of the organisation ought to be, but to explore the situation through the abstract idea of system. This notion is used as "an intellectual construct which is considered to generate (intellectual) order" (Woodburn 1988: 53) to conceptualise different perceptions of the situation. It is emphasised that "conceptualisation is not design, it is a means of structuring the thinking about fuzzy problem situations" (Checkland 1972: 102).

Checkland, thus, differentiates between conceptualisation and design. However, since this statement was made the process of design has been studied and it has been suggested that design cannot occur without concepts to guide the process. 

Checkland (1991a: 70) claims that it is virtually impossible to take part in a SSM process without getting new insights. "The debate which SSM engineers through the comparison phase reveals the norms, the standards, the values extant in the problem situation and contributes to their changing. It is virtually impossible to perform the comparison phase of SSM without modifying the readiness of the participants to perceive the world in a particular way. 'Appreciative settings' will be revealed, as will the degree to which they are changing, could be changed or - in the framework of stated Weltanschauungen - should be changed.

'Design' becomes design of a 'change' selected as a result of the root definition / conceptualisation / comparison process. Design here is not the creation of something which will perform in some specified people-proof way to achieve some defined objective, it is the creation of some modification to which purposeful individuals are prepared to give their commitment.

The essence of SSM lies in five related concepts:
- First, "the process as described on paper is an ideal type, which users must mold to their own purposes". 
- Second, the principal systemicity of SSM "lies in the process of inquiry rather than in the world" and SSM uses holons to inquire the real world.
- Third, "the focus of the approach is on the interaction between theory and practice", i.e. systems theory guide practice which is itself the source of modified theory in a never ending learning process. 
- Fourth, the underlying assumption in SSM is that "learning is a good thing" and that the SSM process "can generate continual learning about human situations, the intentions that arise in them and the realization of those intentions through accommodations between conflicting interests". 
- Fifth, participatory use of these concepts is "the most stimulating and fruitful way"
(Checkland & Haynes 1994: 195).

Or, as sir Geoffrey Vickers (1983a: 8) puts it: "men and their cultures are profoundly influenced by the tools they use".

Finally, standards and modelling tools are of vital importance. They direct us towards what to see and they guide us in how to make sense of real-life experience. Moreover, they simultaneously tell us what to ignore. This means that we focus our inquiry on aspects, or standards, that the model emphasises and, hence, judge other facts that we also experience as irrelevant. It could even occur that we make ourselves blind to other aspects than those in the model when we look for corresponding information in the real-world situation. This is what happens in reductionistic management.

Beer states "the purpose of the system is what it does" (1985:99) and gives no further direction. However, Multi-modal Systems Thinking introduces the "sphere of sovereignty" (de Raadt 1991: 110). Just as each modality has a nucleus which guides and gives meaning to it, every system should be defined by a core modality which guides and gives meaning to the system's purpose. The sphere of sovereignty gives the system its ultimate mission. Further,

"initially systems can have more than one essence in their mission, but as they develop, they become more complex and difficult to manage and therefore they split away from each other and form new social systems each with its unique essence" (de Raadt 1997b:426).

If systems are complex they may have a mission which can be embodied in several modalities, but most social systems have only one modality as its essence. De Raadt interprets the system's sphere of sovereignty as ontological. However, this does not disqualify it from being used empirically.
