### Insights into Service Coming from Biology

_Speaker_: Timothy F.H. Allen (paper coauthored with Duncan Shaw and Peter C. Allen)

The social sciences and business have a preferred presentation of complexity as charts and categories, encouraging contrasts not comparisons. In biology the multiple levels invoked in complexity are treated in a more unified way through comparison. Dualities are expected wherein different levels of analysis can flip examples between types. Thus manufacturing and service can both apply to almost any facet of business. Even heavy industrial manufacture of ingots is a service to industries that make things out of iron. Our general findings are:

1. The difference between manufacture and service pivots on the distinction between high gain rate-dependence for manufacture as opposed to low gain rate-independence for service efficiency. High gain takes in fuel or parts and uses them directly. Low gain takes in low quality material and improves it. Service is low gain, while manufacturing is relatively high gain.
2. Manufacturing is generally easier to outsource, because the output can be moved later.
3. Service generally is smaller than its manufacturing counterpart. The size difference alone takes service out of the realm of manufacturing.
4. Manufacturing creates something while service changes something.
5. Manufacturing uses a process to make a structure that is a good to be sold. Service generally works on some extant structure or situation: e.g. a car or a patient.
6. Whether a product is manufactured item or a service often turns on who is identified as the customer and how they use the product.
7. A century ago industry emerged with a high gain posture. Now the internet and the information age press manufactures into low gain service.
8. The move to low gain can be very lucrative if the clients are the mass at the bottom of the pyramid. There is more profit in service because of low production cost and big markets.
9. Service is like mutualism in biology. It is about cooperation. But the origin of mutualistic relationships is often destructive and predatory. It takes time to work out the accommodation. Service evolves.
10. “Ecosystem services” is a misnomer. It is turned backwards. Human service providers accommodate to the customer in positive terms; the lack of sentience in ecosystems means through depletion they resist offering service. Principles of Supply-side Sustainability show that human exploitation of ecosystems is only stable so long as the ecosystem is itself serviced by its “clients.”
