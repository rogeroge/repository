Much of this piece is not new and draws from any number of sources although the contextual juxtaposition and the relationship between the elements is all my own work. I do not particularly like the academic style of providing the reference together with my own summary - for example if the synopsis of the work is trivial the use of the reference in the style "the moon is round ref: James 1984" adds nothing except to enlist the named author as a supporter of your work. "I believe problem formation is critical ref: Einstein 1928" is a good example where I can draw the big names into my own tract of thinking with association bringing usually unwarranted gravitas.

In contrast some sources provide a depth of explanation and understanding and deserve reference in a much fully way. This is my preference here and thanks to the [[Technical Architecture]] used to deliver this work (hierarchical Hypertext through Obsidian delivered through Perlite) provides the means to annotate the ideas with much fuller cross-referencing. It does sometimes interrupt the flow where the 'rabbit-hole' opened by the reference is interesting and deep, this is how our brains work. I should not apologise necessarily, after all I am compressing my many hours of study into a pithy sentence within the context of the current thread of thinking. If the reference is worthwhile it is not simply a simple echo of the summary but is itself a rich and thought provoking exposition of some related ideas, it should be my job to clarify the linkage I detect but in many cases 

> [!Personal Experience]
> Many years ago I was part of an executive education programme for technologists working in business (then badged as CSC Vanguard currently still operating as TTI Vanguard). During one of the periodic re-organisations the founders of the service left and as part of the replacement exercise the 'senior management' team attended one of the meeting. The format was a presentation usually by some technology pioneer followed questions from the floor. So I duly asked a question of one speaker which, as usual was an invitation to develop on their ideas [[Postmann quoting McLuhan]] . Failing to understand the zeitgeist of the service at the break I was collared by some of the senior managers dashed over to say the answer to my question was, so to speak, '42'. They just did not understand that the question was intended to invite discussion not to seek an answer.

## Plagiarism and Mis-representation
The use of referencing also brings up the issue of plagiarism or mis-representation. Does my use of the material of other's properly credit their contribution and accurately represent their ideas. Failure to credit is plagiarism, failure to understand is mis-representation. In these days of cut & paste (sadly anonymously without automated linkage to the source) some material here is my own, some is inevitably a copy which as this material has been developed over 5 years the sources are lost in time. In order to publish I have embarked on a clean up of the attribution but this may be incomplete, if I have included something produced by someone else please just tell me it may encourage you that I have evidently considered the material to be valuable.

## Things and Their Relationships
There is a spectrum of how we think about situations there is a spectrum of where we focus from the objects or things which are generally tangible to the relationships or influence between things which are more likely to be abstract. In many ways mirrors the ontological and epistemological divide. As I have argued our use of language seldom makes the distinction between the things and their relationships even though this is fundamental to how we understand the situation.

The merit of these different ways of thinking - the concrete thing or abstract relationship - is vividly illustrated by the London Tube Map

> The original map of the London Underground system illustrated the network of stations primarily as they were positioned geographically and was essentially a concrete or ontological view of the situation.

> This view was refined by Harry Beck in what became an iconic image of the London network and was adopted as a design classic by other transport systems. In Beck's representation he exchanged a motif of where the stations were situated geographically to focus on the relationship of the stations to each other on the network, correspondingly the distances between stations were fixed (irrespective of distance) and the proximity of stations together with any interchanges were portrayed by their intervening stations.

> The abstraction afforded by Beck's map also allowed a cartographic 'clean-up' fixing the tube lines as either vertical/horizontal or at the diagonal with stations equally spaced along their lines. This made the map much easier the understand and remember.
