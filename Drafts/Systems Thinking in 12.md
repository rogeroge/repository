Systems Thinking

## System(s): defining the what
### Boundaries: 
The boundaries determine what is included or excluded in the conception of a 'system', it is a necessary bias in the focus on specific elements, a simplification removing excessive detail, a restriction to connected elements and an idealisation of the complex reality
![[Media/Richmond - Extensive and Intensive Model Boundaries.png]]
### Perspectives:
Fusing and comparing the different aspects of 'the system' grounded on their commonalities but aware of the distinctive differences, a focus determine by the specific interests of the observer
![[Media/Nelson - Linstone multiple perspectives.png]]
### (inter-)relationships: 
The properties and behaviours of 'the system' are primarily derived from the properties of the parts and their interrelationship. Specifically the structure of the system is the source of the modification of these properties by means of reconfiguration of the relationships between the parts

![[Media/Fig-A1-The-relation-between-abduction-deduction-and-induction-Several-alternative.png]]
### Type of system: 
Recognising the characteristic type of the system is essential insight provided by 'Thinking', whilst every perspective (characterised by a specific type) is valid some perspective are more useful than others depending on the context.

## Thinking: aspects of why
### Parts & the Whole:
The basic definition of a system [definition] recognises the irreducible connection of the properties of the whole with a specific collection of parts. Our thinking explores the individual parts and their assembly as a whole - it is the essential architecture for nature, for hierarchical systems and for XXX.
![[Media/Abstraction - decomposition - whole parts diagram.jpg]]
### Judgments:
The thinking process is within a context of consciousness and how we observe the world around us and seek the intervene - we 'construct' a problem as the gap between what we observe 'how it is' and what we desire 'how it could be'. This 'gap' is then finessed by our perception and the related judgments which lead to our actions. 
![[Media/appreciative inquiry.png]]
### Analysis & Synthesis: 
Our thinking processes instinctively switch between analysis (drill-down) and synthesis (build-up) but the literature presents a false dichotomy between these polar opposites of a complementary process. Analysis, and reductionism, has one great advantage - its unambiguous efficiency - but analysis, like its twin synthesis, is necessary but not sufficient for understanding. 

![[Media/analysis synthesis concrete abstract .png]]
### Requisite Variety:
The thinking behind Requisite Variety comes from Cybernetics and, too often, is negatively associated with a regime of command and control. If we accept that Systems Thinking goes beyond philosophy into taking action then, whatever we call it, our intent is control. The principles of Requisite Variety and the basics of how we need to think the intervention

### Mess, problems, puzzles:

![[Media/pidd - puzzles messes and problems.png]]
### Problem Resolution: 
We forget that in many cases the 'problem gap' comes from our own construction of event & observations. If we remember this it immediately reveals many more options to dealing with the issues
![[Media/ackoff on taylor.png]]
### Learning & Framing:
Problem solving is often includes a learning process, but as Bateson notes the learning process itself can change the problem formulation and/or solution. Often referred to as 'thinking out of the box' a shift in perspective changes everything. This is what Alan Kay is referring to when he states [[quote kay]]""
![[Media/Types of learning and systems concepts.jpeg]]
## Process: 
The process behind Systems Thinking is the constant flux in the thinking which incorporates the evidence (observations), the framing (system) and the desired (concerns or problem). There is neither a start or end point and no linearity or set direction. Each instance of Systems Thinking concludes when the problem 'gap' is addressed - dissolved, solved, resolved or absolved.

> If you ask “what is the situation that is being observed or considered?” then you are taking a cybernetic stance. If you ask, “what is the system that is being observed or considered?” then you are taking a systems stance. If you are taking a system stance then you are attempting to describe an abstract system that you model as having influence over the parts while the parts are critical to the overall system. If you are taking a cybernetic stance, you are still being systemic, but you do so from a more phenomenological and directive or design point of view, that is a close and intimate observation of the actual situation.
> 
> The situation is not however abstract. It is polysemic and polydimensional. But the situation is always a situation to an observer arising from a set of ‘relevant’ aspects. Situations reproduce themselves in similar contexts just as systems are said to reproduce themselves.
> 
> The situation might be that every time a specific tennis player or team is about to beat a better opponent they flunk it. A systems analysis would attempt to understand the system of say the football team. A cybernetic analysis would consider which aspects of the situation would need to be modified in order to produce a different free flow towards a successful outcome.

> Both of these ways of operating are highly sophisticated and take a lot of learning to do well so this is a tremendous simplification. Cybernetics is useful to robots (although many AI and robotic engineers do not understand it or use it well) precisely because it is precise and deals with actual realities — for example what the camera or sensing mechanism on the robot is actually able to perceive. Both approaches are likely to use “negative feedback” as an aspect of corrections that maintain required goals order.

> Systems thinking is a response to the impotence of reductionism in the face of great complexity (Checkland?)

> We found that instead of thinking that we were addressing ‘systems’ in the world which needed to be improved, we found– because of multiple worldviews– that what we were addressing were ‘situations’ in the world, ones which were seen as problematical. However, we also found that we were building an inquiry process which, in use, needed to be treated as, and constructed as ‘a system’; in fact as a learning system. This shifted the attribution of systemicity from the world to the process of inquiry into the world. This was the paradigm shift which marked and created the hard/soft distinction. The ‘hard’ systems thinker perceives the world as containing systems, some of which do not work very well but can be engineered to work better. The ‘soft’ systems thinker perceives the world as being complex, chaotic to a degree, and changing; but believes that the process of inquiry into the world can be enacted as a learning system. The two outlooks mark a paradigm shift, but we should note that the ‘soft’ outlook does not throw away all the excellent ‘hard’ systems thinking done in the 1950s and 1960s. When it comes to ‘action to improve’ in the use of SSM, the chosen action might well be to design and implement a system to do something, using the ‘hard’ approach. The hard/soft distinction can also be described in terms of underlying assumptions: the hard thinking embodies a philosophy of positivism and a sociology of functionalism; the soft thinking embodies a philosophy of phenomenology and a sociology which is interpretive. (Checkland)

>  I was trying to use systems ideas since real-world  complexity is always a complexity of multiple interacting relationships, and systems ideas are fundamentally about relationships. We carried out ‘action research’ (Checkland and Holwell, 1998) in which we engaged with real-world management problem situations. We found ourselves, in trying to make sense of our experiences, having to use the systems ideas in a radically new way. This entailed applying them to the process of inquiry itself (Checkland, 1999). In this we were abandoning the usual way these ideas are used, which unfortunately follows everyday language in assuming that ‘systems’ exist in the world, as when we casually speak of ‘the education system’ or ‘the legal system’. None of these real-world projects in fact come near to meeting the requirements of the notion ‘system’. Never trust everyday language. (Unfortunately the everyday language use of the word ‘system’ is deeply embedded, even in the thinking of many people in the systems field, who should know better.) (Checkland)

> Vickers made the point that if we consider systems as tangible (ie the Buchanan view) then efficiency [optimisation] and decision making are legitimate targets, if however we treat systems as a construct of an observer (ie the Ashby view) then effectiveness and judgement are the target. Tangible systems are targets for goals, observer systems are candidates for learning. So much of the social and political situations are best considered more as constructs operating in defiance of naive goal setting. By failing to make this distinction clear at the start the reader fails to be guided as to the ‘type’ of ‘system’ and is therefore unsure about the expectations they can have from intervening. You can control a car or a user interface but you have to learn how people will use, or abuse, them. (James)

> The meaning of stability is likely to remain obscured in Western cultures until they rediscover the fact that life consists in experiencing relations, rather than in seeking goals or ‘ends.’ The intrinsic confusion about means and ends arises from the fact that no end can ever be more than a means, if an end is equated with a goal. To get the job or marry the girl is indifferently an end, a means and a goal: it is an opportunity for a new relationship. But the object of the exercise is to do the job and live with the girl; to sustain through time a relationship which needs no further justification, because it is, or is expected to be satisfying in itself. (Vickers)

> In Systems Thinking the "system" is the observation, not that which is being observed. It is not a denial of the complexity and interconnectivity of reality, it is the explicit description of thinking in systems as a sense making process

> William James’s insight in the late 19th Century, that whereas in the inorganic realm, variable ends were attained by consistent means, in the organic realm consistent ends were attained by variable means. (William James)

![[Media/Triadic Structure and Near-Decomposability - Salthe Allen etc.png]]

## The Basic Triadic Structure

> Conceptually linked to the principle of near-decomposability, Salthe (1985) proposed the basic triadic structure for studying complex systems. While near-decomposability focuses on rate differences, the basic triadic structure is based explicitly on the structural levels of a hierarchy. Specifically, it states that three adjacent hierarchical levels need to be considered for both a parsimonious and sufficient description of the behavior of the focal level in the middle (Salthe 1985). This assumes that the dynamics of the focal level is determined primarily by the initiating processes at the level below and the boundary conditions and constraints at the level above. Also, the significance of the focal-level dynamics is understood at the higher level, where as the mechanistic explanations of the focal-level dynamics comes from the lower level.

## Kay

> *Coherence*
> We are storytellers, operating much of the time in worlds of make believe. We do not find that the realm of imagination and ideas is an alternative to, or retreat from, practical reality. On the contrary, it is the only way we have found to think seriously about reality. In a way, there is nothing more to this method than maintaining the conviction . . . that imagination and ideas matter . . . there is no practical alternative. 
> 
> *Simon Decision Making*
> Good decisions often result from leaps of the imagination. Creativity was the quality exhibited by that unknown Sumerian who invented the wheel, by Einstein, and by Steve Jobs. And, as Knight and Keynes emphasised, creativity is inseparable from uncertainty. By its nature, creativity cannot be formalised, only described after the event, with or without the help of equations. 
> 
> *Decision Calibration - the gap between the quantifiable (the informed) and the rest **(do as you please)***
> A mystery cannot be solved as a puzzle can. [Narrative] reasoning through mysteries requires us to acknowledge ambiguities and to resolve them sufficiently to clarify our thinking. But even to frame a problem requires skill and judgement. That is one of the most important contributions that economists can make. A mystery must first be framed, well or badly, to aid people in reaching the decisions they have to make in conditions of radical uncertainty. 

This builds on Allen's discussion on the role of narrative and Ashby's comment on decision making ***Use all that you know to shrink the range of possibilities to their minimum; after that, do as you please***- it is to stimulate an awareness of the information gap and the necessary coherence of the whole.
## Problems

### The causes of the problem
- the causes are not known or understood
- those addressing the problem caused it
- the causes are other problems

### The requirements of the problem
- the requirements are unknown
- the requirements are conflicting
- the requirements will emerge with the solutions.

### The process of addressing the problem
- trying to solve the problem changes the problem
- problem-solving efforts will never end
- the process is unknown.

### The solutions to the problem
- solutions won't ever be perfect
- solution ideas will be untestable
- solutions will disadvantage those developing them

> I will outline three common, but independent, research practices that avoid building precise theories of psychological processes: (a) the null ritual, which specifies a precise null hypothesis and allows researchers to get away with not specifying their research hypothesis; (b) as-if theories, which do not model psychological processes in the first place; and (c) lists of binary oppositions, which avoid specifying psychological processes. (Gigerenzer)

## Narrative

Importantly, narrative is not about the telling of objective truth, but is rather about finding a consonance of meaning between independent observers. The narrative helps the storyteller and the listener find commensurate experience.

‘The notion of multiple-identities is central to hierarchical thinking, Several writers have suggested that the very definition of hierarchical systems invokes the use of multiple-identities: 

- “a dissipative system is hierarchical when it operates on ‘multiple space-time scales - that is when different process rates are found in the system” (O'Neill, 1989).
- “systems are hierarchical when they are analyzable into successive sets of subsystems” (Simon, 1962, p. 468)—in this case we can consider them as “near-decomposable” in Simon's terminology. 
- “a system is hierarchical when alternative methods of description exist for the same system” (Whyte et al., 1969) 

We claim that an epistemological analysis of the implication of hierarchy theory has to start with the juxtaposition of a semiotic universe and a physical universe.

### Four Fingerprints of Complex Systems

One example of a particular author’s perspective in developing classifications of these principles is the ‘four fingerprints of complex systems’ proposed by Casti (1992) of irreducibility, instability, adaptability and emergence. Using these systems approaches requires an understanding of these principles and how they are incorporated into the methodology being used.

## On Levelism

>  To sum up: just as no thing or organism exists on its own, it does not  act on its own. Furthermore, every organism is a process: thus the organism is not other than its actions. To put it clumsily: it is what it does. More precisely, the organism, including its behaviour, is a process  which is to be understood only in relation to the larger and longer process of its environment. For what we mean by "understanding" or "comprehension" is seeing how parts fit into a whole, and then realizing that they don't compose the whole, as one assembles a jigsaw puzzle,  but that the whole is a pattern, a complex wiggliness, which has no  separate parts. Parts are fictions of language, of the calculus of looking  at the world through a net which seems to chop it up into bits. Parts exist only for purposes of figuring and describing, and as we figure the world out we become confused if we do not remember this all the time. (Walls)

This quote opens up our thinking that 'the parts' are themselves a convenient fiction, even tangible parts, such as an engine, are composed of multiple 'parts' each of which is composed of multiple 'parts' and so on. We compound the fiction of the parts by thinking of wholes as if they were parts - the engine has a pump, the pump has a piston, the piston has a shim and so on to the 'real' parts which are the castings. In the assembly of the 'real' parts we combine and cojoin the 'elemental' parts into whole which themselves have 'emergent properties' but which we abstract as a new 'part' with embedded 'properties' - conveniently overlooking the wholeness of the designate part and the emergent nature of the properties of that whole.

*What then is 'special' about the emergent properties we choose other then an observer imposed focus built around a fictional concept.*

It amplifies and explains the thinking about levels and hierarchy within thinking about systems. Walls identifies the top limit, the environment, in which everything sits and, by elimination, the lower limit of inanimate, components parts which are recursively assembled in order to generate properties. Our thinking, the hallucination or fiction, concern a 'slice' between these limits, a slice which is chosen around a observer's insight and for a specific purpose.

To paraphrase Denis Noble "*there is no privileged level for emergence*"

The point is that the tools/methods/approaches are themselves based on a given perspective. So there is an incestuous thinking cycle - the observer chooses the instrument which prejudices the observation and then the observer stipulates the mental model which interprets the evidence.

So 'any method you like providing it is XXXX' (hat tip to Ford).

The abiding principle is summarised by the Box dictum first "all models are wrong some models are useful" emphasises the hallucination TOGETHER WITH "the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful"

It is this continued dialectic between "Hallucination and Reality" and "predictions right and predictions wrong" that is the strength of Systems Thinking. It is why Churchman wrote about humility.

Mike's CST explores this dialectic once when you first choose the cell of the matrix and thereafter discards any concerns and re-evaluation of whether the facts fit the fiction.
## Master Definition

Systems thinking is concerned with how the properties of the inside are manifested on the outside.

Pre-supposes a boundary between the inside and the outside - and a set of properties or behaviours which are of interest.

***Can we have a stacked list of aphorisms - starting with the above but also parts and wholes, emergence etc?***

## Hermeneutics

![[Media/Krippendorff - Hermeneutic cycle - coherence between parts and wholes.png]]

So emergence requires an implicit recognition of wholes and parts.

For the simplest of explanations go to a literal definition:

Systems Thinking is taking a composite view of situations based on a compositional stance (the system) meshed with a conceptual stance (the thinking) in order to develop an understanding leading to practical action.

Approaches for understanding situations centred on ..
- Systems (what we all do! incorporates boundary decisions, a specific focus, wholes & parts, and is plural I.e. multiple perspectives) [Compositional stance]
- Thinking (what we all do! framing, modelling, abstraction, use of metaphors etc) [Conceptual stance]

The different approaches (SSM, SODA, SD, VSM etc) emphasise different aspects & biases applicable in specific situations.

If you follow this definition, Systems Thinking is not a thing but an ever developing capability in each practitioner achieved through experience/learning.

Similarly Systems Dynamics is an aspect of (or approach in) Systems Thinking but is not of itself Systems Thinking. For example settling on just Systems Dynamics as Systems Thinking is a beginners error of someone who has not been on the learning journey or more often is used as a false comparison for marketing purposes.

### Levels and Emergence

Ryan quotes Checkland

> It is the concept of organized complexity which became the subject matter of the new discipline 'systems'; and the general model of organized complexity is that there exists a hierarchy of levels of organization, each more complex than the one below, a level being characterized by emergent properties which do not exist at the lower level. Indeed, more than the fact that they 'do not exist' at the lower level, emergent properties are meaningless in the language appropriate to the lower level. (Checkland)

The level is manifest by a demarcation of the whole and the parts. Emergence is when the collective properties of the system does not align to the individual properties of the parts. Complexity is when the

Futures research's conventional focus on 5-50 year timespans 𝐟𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐬 to fully capture the complex relationship between temporal scales and different types of possibility in shaping possible futures.

Instead of choosing a time scale and asking what is possible within it, we should first figure out what is possible and how well we can track those possibilities. Only then should we decide on a time period that fits those possibilities.

https://lnkd.in/dzt3wwty

To see this, consider the following - and see the image below:

The future cone model in futures research is problematic. It presents different types of possibilities (predictable, plausible, probable, desirable, alternative, and conceivable futures) as coexisting at any moment in time and shows an ever-expanding space of possibilities. Both these assumptions are flawed.

Contrary to the model's idea, the different types of futures should shrink in size the further we look into the future, not maintain their relative proportions. For example, it becomes increasingly difficult to predict or judge as probable anything in long timescales due to inaccuracies in our current descriptions and external influences. Similarly, producing plausible scenarios based on credible assumptions becomes harder over time.

This means different areas in the future cone should disappear at different points as we move forward in time. The timescale we can use in analyzing the future depends on what type of possibility we are satisfied with - plausible futures allow for shorter-term analysis, while conceivable futures permit looking much further ahead.

The idea of an expanding space of possibilities is also questionable. There are likely limits to what is possible, and assuming an ever-expanding set of possibilities naively presumes continual human development and increased capabilities. Given existential challenges like climate change and nuclear weapons, it is possible that future paths could converge on catastrophe, shrinking the cone to a small line rather than circle.

Importantly, the difficulties in describing different types of futures (predictable, plausible, possible, etc.) cannot be derived from the assumption that the space of possibilities is expanding. We cannot determine whether possibilities multiply over time without first studying what is predictable, plausible, and possible.

In conclusion, we should not be constrained by the intuition that possibilities multiply as we move forward in time. The future cone model, while a useful tool, should be approached critically, recognizing its limitations in representing the complex relationship between time and different types of possibility in futures research.

This version is from: “How to visualise futures studies concepts: Revision of the futures cone” by Gall, Vallet & Yannou” (Futures 143, 2022).
![[Media/Futures Cone.jpeg]]

An excellent analysis - the picture is highly misleading which suggests it appropriate to 'over-indulge' in the exponential rise in probability without qualifying these conjectures 'as you go' - it is to mistakenly expand the noise in a vain hope to find a signal. [Remember Turing's contribution to the Enigma code-breaking was how to trim the infeasible from the possibility space, he did not crack the code directly but made the cracking process more efficient!].

The cone is not filled with equi-valid "P's" but is a thinly populated lattice linked with coherent threads. Equally the starting position is not a point but itself a 'volume' populated by the conditions and constraints of the situation up to the starting point. History counts!

The 'nearly' equal and opposite convergent process focuses down each 'slice' of the cone onto a target of practicality as per the attached illustration on the process of landing the speculation and refining the signal from the noise.

## Counterfactuals

We need to distinguish between
- it is what it is (the situation)
- it is what it isn't (counterfactuals)
- it isn't what it isn't (impossibilities)

The situation is pinned to and defined by a specific history of components and events, it therefore has an observable reality/tangibility. The counterfactual shares the same composition as the situation but, as of now, the specific have not been observed although the conditions that would make it possible are in place. The impossibilities have neither an observed composition or condition.

The situation only requires an observation (pattern to heuristic) to be validated, the counterfactual requires a 'wave equation' which is a container for all the end points predicted by a model of the container and conditions. Clearly it is shaped by the composition and can only be defined by some information model [TW Deacon]. 

The correspondence and instantiation of specific situations from an array of one ultimate particular (a single factual) and any number of counterfactuals is the most difficult step. How can a speculative configuration be 'landed' as a tangible reality. There have been a number of attempts to extend the Laws of the Physic to [Balatini TRIZ MAthematics]

The futility of an untrammelled imagination stuck in the impossibilities is that there is no 'landing' mechanism, we can imagine a world in which things exists but to do so is to abandon all of the Laws on Nature and to ignore both the intended consequences and the unintended consequences. For example how can you make the atoms of Aluminium in an aeroplane be weightless and all the other Aluminium atoms obey the laws of gravity?

> How can you discriminate between the situation produced signal and the observer induced noise? 

Time and - are just the sequence of things [Ashby? on time]
