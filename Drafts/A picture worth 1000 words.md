On Pictures ....
Now please don't get me wrong I love visualisations and pictures and subscribe to the adage that ' a picture is worth 1000 words' but I also see visualisation as a major distraction in (some) systems thinking without rigour and structure the pictures serve to amplify complexity rather than reduce it [and as we know problem resolution consists of the divergent process of analysis and the convergent process of synthesis] - simply more needle perhaps but substantially more hay! For example the foresight study on Obesity for example - eg p69 in

There is an excellent discussion of the insight/complexity/feasibility relationships of practical solutions in feasibility space referenced by Chapman & Ward in their book on Managing Project Risk and Uncertainty - the key relationship is available at

but I would also recommend the full book
In many ways the discussion on Physics cannot be independent of the observer - the ?Physics Way? has a compact clarity in describing complex phenomena - which is elegant and seductive Other aspects of nature can also be represented by a similar clarity but this is no guarantee, there are systems that are so complex that the only satisfactory model of the system is the system itself - this is a restatement of Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety. The advice has to be "by all means seek elegant simplicity but don't expect it". If you delve into the Systems thinking literature many of the subject leaders expressed the paradox of simplicity within complexity, and complexity within simplicity. One of my favourites is Sir Geoffrey Vickers who is quoted as saying "people are more predictable than the weather" - with the implication that whilst both are complex systems the purposefulness of people introduce "hidden rules" which create more order than you would expect.
For Mark's recent comments - on the inability of regulation to cope - one of the best sources comes from an analysis if the recent financial problems and asks the question - was the situation more complex that the system designed to manage it [the incompetence theory] or were the loopholes deliberately introduced but exploited excessively [the conspiracy theory]. The author - Mike Mainelli - is one of the leading thinkers in the area and the full report is available at
