### Better maps or better science
> - Maps, as with all of our representations for ideas, are quite arbitrary and don't automatically have any intrinsic claims to accuracy. For example, here are 3 maps. The first is a map from the Middle Ages, the second is a map from Tolkein's "Lord of the Rings", and the third is a map of the Mojave Desert. The medieval "T-O" map shows the world as they thought "it had to be", and includes the Garden of Eden (to the Far East at the top). The Mediterranean (the middle of the world) is the vertical of the "T", Jerusalem is at the center of the world at the joining of the "T", and the boot of Italy is just a bulge. The Tolkein map was made up in careful detail to help readers (and probably the author) to visualize the fictitious world of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. The map of the Mojave Desert was made last year using both advanced surveying methods and satellite imagery to guide the placement of features. 
> - It is important to realize that from the standpoint of traditional logic, none of these maps is "true", in that none of them are in exact one-to-one correspondence with all the details of what they are trying to map. In other words each of these maps is a kind of story that is written mostly in images rather than words. Within a map we can do perfect logic -- so for example, if Rome is North of Alexandria, and Paris is North of Rome then Paris is North of Alexandria. This internal logic works perfectly for all three maps. Mathematics is also a kind of mapping system that is set up to be completely consistent within itself -- in fact, it includes the making of maps like these ("Earth Measuring" in Greek is "Geometry"). It's when we try to relate the maps to what they are supposed to represent "outside" that we run into difficulty and find that none of them are "true" in the sense of the truth that can obtain inside a map. But if you were dropped into the Mojave Desert, which "not-true" map would you choose to take with you? Many flavors of "false" really makes a difference in modern thinking!  (Kay)
### Scale - Simon view from an ant 

> We watch an ant make his laborious way across a wind- and wave-molded beach. He moves ahead, angles to the right to ease his climb up a steep dunelet, detours around a pebble, stops for a moment to exchange information with a compatriot. Thus he makes his weaving, halting way back to his home. So as not to anthropomorphize about his purposes, I sketch the path on a piece of paper. It is a sequence of irregular, angular segments--not quite a random walk, for it has an underlying sense of direction, of aiming toward a goal.
> 
> Viewed as a geometric figure, the ant’s path is irregular, complex, hard to describe. But its complexity is really a complexity in the surface of the beach, not a complexity in the ant. On that same beach another small creature with a home at the same place as the ant might well follow a very similar path. (Simon)

#### Axes - continuous and orthogonal
#### Reification - thinking complexity etc is real warfield

> In making sense of what is a burgeoning literature on complexity, I found it useful to formulate a typology of ways I experience the term complexity being used by different interest groups. I surprised myself somewhat by adopting this approach. In the past, I have been critical of the way typologies have been used. My negativity is triggered whenever I experience someone using a typology to argue ‘this is how things are’. Another way of saying this is that they are reified: this happens when a concept is converted mentally into a real thing or fact. (Ison)

This is the challenge of studying - is the commonality between the current situation a question of a similar type or of similar behaviours? For example the use of metaphor?. If we start with the inverse definition - complexity is a set of behaviours apparent when there is no obvious explanation, the observed behaviour goes beyond the component parts - it is the implicit recognition that there is a schema or architecture at work. Similarly cheaviours - the challenge and ambiguity lies not with what it is (the parts are concrete and tangible but with (our thinking of) how it behaves. There is a component <> behaviour gap.

The gap has many expressions [how might we]

#### Contested Concept

> Complexity is a term that is contested by different interest groups. As yet  we do not have the right language to speak about the range of concepts to which complexity is attributed. There appear to be, however, four main groupings:.
> 
1. Complexity is a property of something.
	(a) Complexity refers to the condition of the universe, which is too rich and varied for us to understand in simple, common mechanistic or linear ways.
	(b) Complex systems.
	(c) Complex adaptive systems.
	(d) Complex responsive processes.
	
1. Complexity is something we experience and thus what is complex will differ depending on who is experiencing– this is sometimes described as perceived complexity.
2. Complexity is an emerging discipline
	(a) Complexity is a new science– or at least we are asked to accept that it is. Some claim this includes artificial intelligence, cognitive science, ecology, evolution, game theory, linguistics, social science, artificial life, computer science, economics, genetics, immunology, philosophy (e.g. LGMB, 1996, p.16; and Battram, 1998).
	(b) Complexity theory (which among others includes organismic complexity, structural complexity, hierarchic complexity and dynamic complexity and so on).
3. Complexity, or complexity ‘something’ is used to describe a new way of thinking about the world (a trans-discipline, or meta-discipline) or a new paradigm.
	(a) Complexity deals with the nature of emergence, innovation, learning and adaptation.
	(b) Complexity is an organizing adjective and results in different metaphor clusters or is a source of analogy.

- Classification - reduces options, it the dominant process is one of search it is highly efficient, if the focus is on synthesis the keyword is 'and'
- Problem with a 'square' map based on dichotomy which disallows trade-offs or triangulation - hexagons for tessellation
- Limited dimensionality - PCA hybrid axes and pure axis, to be used in complexity
- False proximity or distance - tube map
- Hidden purpose - propaganda
- False investment of thought - expectation of patterns and relationships, what are they wrong - Hoare 
## Matrices as Correct

- as an aid to pattern forming - original use by Zimmerman
- cardboard cut-out
- licence to discuss
- metaphor paper
