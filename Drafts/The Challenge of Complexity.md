[Homage to David Reed's Get the Verbs Right]

We begin with the nature of a complex system and the evidence of tell-tale behaviours such as emergence, it is a clear indicator that the traditional approach to explanation - via analytical reductionism - has run out of steam and the behaviour of the whole is more than simply the addition of the behaviour of the parts. (Note: this does not mean that an analytical step of parts identification is not required on the path to understanding).

If then an understanding of the parts is inadequate to explain the behaviours of the whole the question is what are the missing components? My contention is that it lies with the structure of the whole, a structure which influences and moderates the interrelationship between the parts. Architecture is the study of structure (literally) which allows the properties of suitably designed assemblies to transcend the limitation of the parts, architecture is a mental 'trick' or abstraction in that it explains phenomenon which are not obvious once the underlying mechanism is revealed.

> So in architecture, let’s make some arches—it’s where the term came from.  And these things are incredibly efficient. ....  By the way, the Frost Giants in the Wagner operas came out of the inability of the Goths and the Visigoths to tear down these aqueducts in the Dark Ages; they concluded only giants could have built them.  But in fact it was just people like us with some technique (Kay).

There are two aspects of architecture that are important in a wider discussion of complexity

- Architecture incorporates non-integral components to have a material effect in the final structure (& behaviours). For example a building scaffold.
- Architecture designs build behaviours from a (structure determined) fusion of the materiality of the parts and the abstract nature of the structure.

In a few special cases, such as a gear train, the structure is transparent and the methods by which it transforms the interrelationships between the parts is visible. In many example of Complexity these mechanism are not so evident even though their impact is real and aspects of their structure can be imagined.

### Thoughts on the Parts and the Whole

The distinction between the properties of the parts and the properties of the whole is evident as an inversion of the phrase form follows function (applicable to the parts) and function follows form (applicable to the whole). It is a thinking process/stance that reverses the expected order of things and by so doing destroys the 'natural' convergence of thought - we are used to a convergence of factor to a root cause (n to 1) and a deterministic attribution of cause producing an effect. Instead we are faced with a divergent process - which one of many possible causes - and a probabilistic attribution of known effect but many possible causes. It has all the characteristic behaviour of a chain - determinate and dominant when pulled and indeterminate and directionless when pushed.

#### Impossible Futures and Improbably Histories from Imagined Scaffolding 

The other aspect of non-integral component can be explained by the use of scaffolding, for an arch the supporting scaffold is integral & necessary when the structure is built but can be completely absent in the finished structure. We can postulate that the structural scaffold is required to assemble the structure even if we have no evidence of its existence even less its use. It is an intriguing construct (literally and metaphorically) in [Deacons] view of evolution.

Note; Two of the most interesting themes in the understanding of Complexity are unusually the focus of intense academic arguments over plagarism. The works of Deacon, Lissack and Juarrero in the relationship of  

Thinking about the role of scaffolding however provides an explanation of the role of information and the position of counterfactuals in speculation about the future or the past even if it has limited/zero insight and impact on the current physical reality, it leads to the conclusion that information is an intriguing only because it is a vocabulary of the non-physical hypotheticals. It is an artefact of the hallucination which surrounds the tangibility of the now situation.

Of course it is part of human nature to want to understand the patterns of the past and act on projections of the future but a more sanguine and humble attitude to the fragility and [personal nature] of the construct is required. [the tragedy of unintended consequences]

### In the World or in the Mind (or both)?

### Rosen

> Rosen starts his discussion of complexity from the basic duality between the self and everything else (1991). One can experience the self, but everything else, or what Rosen calls the “external world” (1991: 41), is not directly accessible. According to Rosen, one’s understanding of the external world is based on modelling. Modelling consists of establishing congruence between one’s entailment system and the external world. Entailment invokes a loop of logical consistency surrounding the model, “if, if, if, then.” Rosen invokes a causal loop of entailment in the functioning of the observed. He works with observables not reality. A modelling relation is established when “we have brought at least a part of the inferential machinery . . . into congruence with a corresponding part of the [observed system]” (1991: 54). Complexity arises when a system does not match the predictions of the formal model used to describe it. A simple system is one that can be correctly predicted by a model. A complex system is one which cannot be fully simulated, or computed, using models. In Rosen’s words, a complex system “must have a nonsimulable model” (Rosen, 2000: 292). Complexity would “require, at best, an infinite number of distinct formalizations to capture all the qualities” (Rosen, 1991: 9) missed by the entailment system of computable models. Complexity is thus a relational property, derived from the comparison between the observed system and its model. Rosennean complexity is an epistemological issue, not a property of the external world. Nevertheless, complexity has material consequences. (Allen)
### The Goldilocks Matrix

When I use a word - exactly what I mean it to mean

- too boring
- too simple
- too hard
- just about right (aka complex)

### Are Complex Systems Real?

The elements/components are accurately described by what is present (concrete), equally the cause is described by the architecture (rarely visible, often abstract). The landmark work in explaining this relationship is the eponymously titled "Sciences of the Artificial" by Herb Simon.

### The Paradox of Classification

If the study of complexity is the investigation of the (invisible) architectures (structures) which introduce the novel behaviours we are left to study their tangible expression/manifestation as behaviours or relationships between the parts. We have a real outcome - the behaviour - based on an abstract explanation - our model of the structure.

The first use of the matrix emerged from a classification of examples to amplify the commonality of different examples of 'complexity'. This was an attempt to recognise the patterns of common behaviours even if there was no visible common cause, it was to emphasise the common relationships rather than the common components. It's first use was designed to identify patterns of relationships not to catalogue parts.

However the use of the Stacey matrix makes this intention backfire. By reifying complexity as a real thing we are led down a cull-de-sac in thinking, in Complexity we should be thinking about common abstractions expressed as relationships and manifest as behaviours, we should not be thinking about complexity as a real thing. Complexity is not an immutable characteristic of the system components but is an abstract relationship manifest by the particular structural relationship and structural history of the parts.

> Systems learning, then, seeks:  . . . to uncover and understand relationships, grasp the patterns that connect, and recognise the embeddedness of systems and their interdependencies. In systems learning, synthesis is the primary mode of inquiry. (Ison quoting Banathy)

### Explaining the Trap (of closing down options)

> Immanuel Kant's role in philosophy often resembles that of a judge, especially when he warns us about antinomies which means "against the law." The danger, as Kant describes it arises when we mistake reason for reality, a mental trap called "reification." Generally, this isn't an issue; for example, when we predict the weather, whether it rains or not doesn't really matter. However, the trouble starts when we imagine that by taking two opposing and mutually contradictory views we imagine ourselves to have considered all possible realities and imagine ourselves masters of the universe. For instance, if you think adopting a bearish bull trading strategy, is a sure way to a 'solving the market', you're sure to end badly as you're bound to be blindsided by a so-called Black Swan-an unforeseen event that disrupts everything.
### Simplification is Compression

The next step in a process of abstract thinking is the generalisation of the observed patterns, this compresses an often overwhelming set of 'special cases' to a smaller set of principles. [mozart example] As [David Reed] explains the merit of thinking in verbs, and identifying the strong verbs allows the confusion of multiple variations to be represented in an economical fashion.

> At its core, this dichotomy is between low-level simplicity, which is infinitely composable and easier to use but also requires more repeated work to build larger wholes, and complex abstraction which captures some core patterns and intuitions but forces you to follow its rules and constraints. (https://www.lesswrong.com/out?url=https%3A%2F%2Fepistemologicalfascinations.substack.com%2Fp%2Flibs-vs-frameworks-middle-level-regularities)

### Abstract Groups

When we start to think in the abstract we move away from a consideration of individual behaviours to the characteristics of the groups - from the specifics of the individual particular to the common features of a group. The example of which is to think about my pile of bricks focusing less on a specific configuration but abstracting out the way the properties are modified by all piles of bricks. It is this process of abstraction which leads to the dangerous phenomenon of inattentive blindness, or the [Denis Noble] explanation of bias/focus in the observation process. The thinking in abstractions enables the recognition of the patterns required for a common cause explanation of causality but prevents a naive untrained view of the situation.

#### Relationship between investment and complexity

[picture of nouns and verbs]

Nouns provide the gateway to the use of the metaphor and the analogy as a route to abstraction

The use of the matrix reinforces the thinking about things (nouns) as opposed to thinking about relationships (verbs). Ironically the matrix framing as dimensional dichotomies is inherently a reductionist technique which, as explained earlier, is inadequate to explain complexity. In terms of simplicity it a triumph of style over substance as it is a cut-out technique not a cut-through approach.

### From Nouns to Verbs

> Complexity is the study of effects with weaving (complex). It is to be contrasted with the merely complicated (complic, meaning with folds). Although the complicated can be unfolded for analysis, the complex cannot’ (Letiche et al. 2011: 12)

#### wicked problems

> ‘What makes a problem ‘wicked’ is the impossibility of giving it a definitive formulation: the information needed to understand the problem is dependent upon one’s idea of solving it. Furthermore, there is no stopping rule: we cannot know whether we have a sufficient understanding to stop searching for more understanding. There is no end to causal chains interacting in open systems of which the climate is the world’s prime example. So, every wicked problem can be considered as a symptom of another problem: the relationships are therefore complex (multi-faceted) in contrast to complicated (multiple, but mono-faceted). If there is premature foreclosure, we may become prisoners of our own assumptions’ (Prins & Rayner)


> The term ‘incommensurability’ should present less of a problem since its meaning is quite specific: lack of a common measure. 
> The word ‘paradigm’, used in an ordinary language sense, can evoke synonyms such as ‘map’ (see, for example, Burrell and Morgan, 1979: xi), representation, exemplar, (or, indeed, possibly any of Kuhn’s supposed 22, or thereabouts, different ways of using it). In other words, a paradigm is a model. There are two characteristics that all models share: they must contain less information than that which they model (‘the real world’) and they are ‘good’ or ‘bad’ as models (of ‘the real world’) only insofar as they serve the purposes of the person creating/using the model (see, for example, Ashby, 1970). What is not contained within the concept of ‘paradigm’ (model) is an inevitable incommensurability with other models. Incommensurability, if it exists, is a ‘design feature’ of the model.

> He gives us an example of a self-refuting statement: “All generalisations are false” (ibid.). This statement is paradoxical. It is syntactically correct, but semantically false. It is self-refuting because it is, in itself, a generalisation and, therefore, according to the statement itself, must be false.

> Jackson and Carter’s examination of McKelvey’s From field to science: can Organization Studies make the transition? (2003) is wide-ranging but their primary concerns are with his claim that the notion of paradigm incommensurability is self-refuting and with his suggestion that organization studies can and should be reconstructed as a unified field on the basis of a ‘contra-science’ ontology and ‘normal science’ epistemology. On the alleged self-negation of paradigm incommensurability, McKelvey argues that if we know enough about another paradigm to state that it is incommensurate with our own, that knowledge is sufficient to make it commensurate. Jackson and Carter point out that what is established by this argument is not the self-refuting nature of paradigm incommensurability but that of McKelvey’s own argument. It is self-refuting, in other words, to suppose that the establishment of the incommensurability of another paradigm requires the extent and kind of knowledge which would establish its commensurability. The sentence in which it is expressed, they say, is syntactically correct but semantically false. McKelvey’s response is to repeat his original argument and assert with some force that a sentence which contains meaningful words cannot be semantically false - from which it presumably follows that colourless green ideas do indeed sleep uneasily.
>  
> Quite what is meant by the opposition between ‘normal science’ and contra-science’ in McKelvey’s two-by-two matrix is not very clear, nor is the manner in which he understands ‘science’. His biographical note, however, suggests that his models are physics and biology, but that still leaves much for conjecture. Is ’normal science’ to be understood in the Kuhnian sense in which it is differentiated from ‘revolutionary science’, and if so, why is it only normal science that is opposed to ‘contra-science’? What, come to that, is ‘contra-science’? Given these uncertainties, Jackson and Carter do their best to make sense of McKelvey’s proposed reconstruction of organization studies, interpreting ‘contra science’ ontology as an articulation in which the world is “socially constructed, observer-dependent and of dubious transcendence”. On that basis, they ask how it is possible to produce a science-like knowledge of a world which has no objective existence. McKelvey’s reply does not much clarify the issue, since his chosen illustration — “Campbellian Realism” - appears to combine a realist ontology and relativist epistemology rather than the contra science ontology and normal science epistemology which he advocates. In fact “Campbellian Realism” as McKelvey describes it, lies in a quadrant of his matrix which he says is inhabited by no-one but the odd “nut”.
>  
> There is much else in McKelvey’s rejoinder , and we would not wish to spoil it for the reader by revealing too much in advance. We should make it clear, though, that he confirmed that he was happy for it to be published as it stands. With that in mind we can only wonder at the inclusion of  “Milton Keynes” in a list of great thinkers and the economic geography which locates London as “where people make money” and The North as “where they make lots of grass, cows, and sheep”.
