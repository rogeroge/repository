> The descriptive multivariate methods went into disrepute, and instead population equations were introduced as proof of mechanism. Like ordinations, population equations are only hypothesis generators, the proof in them being mathematical, not of material observables. But that was forgotten by, or otherwise lost on, those enjoying the new rigor. Soon naive realists were searching for the one true mechanism~if they could only find it. Alfred Korzybski made famous the idea that the map is not the territory (Bateson 1980). The system itself is not a mechanism. Mechanistic accounts are fixed within a narrow range of explanation. Models are most effective when they are put in a proper context.


When the physical environment is put inside the system, along with the biota, organisms melt away and become connectors of, say, primary productivity and the detritus compartment.

IMHO the central dilemma is that they (MJ, etc) focus on the detail to try and fix the extent

A more honest & established decomposition goes ... starting with a situation ..
- what is immutable and what is variable? (delineates the context and the resources)
- what is observable and what is hidden? (delineates the agency and scope for purposeful change)
- how can we frame the possibilities for change? (identifies the model used for sensemaking)
- how can we predict the future behaviours? (employs a mechanism used for understanding?)

Going top down - variable-observable-possible-predictable - the constrains allow a set of options at each level. Going bottom-up the suppositions at each level fix the degrees of freedom above it. These assumption have the characteristics of a chain - top down it is a chain when pulled (robust shape following), bottom up it is a chain when pushed (under specific conditions with a narrow tolerance it maintains its integrity but all too easily collapses).

The problem we have is navigating the stack from the wrong point - like playing Jenga from the bottom first. Each scientific proof itself a mechanism (aka reductionism) is a composite of the choices made by way of scope, observation and model. It should never be, and cannot be a 'shape defining' criteria.

We start with a Rich Diagram to visualise all of the issues or we can start with an influence map - positioning the causal triggers in a space determined by history - time (now to past) and proximity (proximate-between the local & concrete and distant-between the remote & abstract). The proximity axis bifurcates as you traverse away from the single focus on local and concrete, we separate the evolution into families. 

For each focal point, or cause of the behaviour, we dissect the factors by interrogation as I, P and Bs in order the investigate the hierarchy between essence, paradigm, model and (possibly) mechanism

A picture for the words.

The hierarchy essence-paradigm/narrative-model-mechanism comes from Tim Allen, but it is the skeleton on which we 'think about' situations. Entering anywhere and yo-yoing up and down until we are happy with the fit.

The dimensions of interrelationship-perspective-boundary are the ways in which we make the movement and the questions we will be asking.

The real world/observer world distinction andf the choice of verb - establish vs envisage. We select aspects of the real world (choose aka establish) and we imagine in the observer world (model aka envisage).

The 'top' levels of the hierarchy start with what we can conceive as changing [if nothing can be changed we have no interest] and how we know something has/can be changed [if nothing can be observed we cannot know if we are making any difference], The process begins by identifying a pattern of something in something.

The 'bottom' levels how we make sense of these observations. In some cases the expansion to  a mechanism is not always achieved. For example as an engineer we might use a heuristic for prediction.

Science is a 'full house' where we have a coherent set of essence-paradigm-model-mechanism. Engineering is essence-paradigm-model-heuristic. and so on. 

If we explore a situation (my example of Grenfell or the NHS) we can start with a rich picture to expose all the issues or produce an 'influence map'. The influence map is to identify the critical points in the space of history/time [immediate-historical] versus proximity [local & concrete - abstract and distant]. Then for each critical point we develop the essence-paradigm-model-mechanism framework by iterating around IPB.

On the NHS the number of attendances at A&E has numerous 'causal points' an immediate/local cause - the demand from increasing old people, and a historical/distance cause such as the 1948 decision to keep care funding under the local health authorities.


For a system of study, then, a paradigm is a narrative that specifies what is: 
1. *Continuous and therefore readily quantifiable as opposed to discrete and therefore inviting a qualitative description.* Whereas the number of eggs in a nest is an integer, and is in that sense discrete, it is a variable number for which only a special case of variation is counted. Three eggs is almost as many as four, which cannot be said about being pregnant. A woman is either pregnant or not, with "almost pregnant" having no meaning. Pregnancy is discrete any way you look at it, whereas three being almost four has meaning. Although three is not four, it is closer to four than, say, two. But closer or further from pregnant is like the sound of one hand clapping, nonsense fashioned from conflicting definitions. One could change the level of analysis from pregnancy to pregnancy rates, but that is a different discourse. 
2. *Structural and emergent as opposed to behavioural and dynamic*. Structures emerge, whereas a structure-changing state is dynamic behaviour. Change of state is not the structural all-or-nothing that pertains to a new structure coming into existence, or at least achieving observability or recognition. 
3. *A significant difference as opposed to an incidental difference.* Acid rain causing acidification is associated with a change in pH beyond a certain threshold at which significance arises. Daily change in pH because of photosynthesis and respiration rates is only an incidental difference if the description is of acid rain damage. 
4. *Rate dependent and process-oriented as opposed to rate independent and linguistic.* A ball may fall at a rate, but it is not a ball at a rate; it just is a ball. 
5. *The whole as opposed to a part.* This distinction fixes the level on analysis. 
6. *The type of the whole.* To what equivalence class has the whole been chosen to belong? 

Unfortunately, models are now mistaken to be the whole purpose of the enterprise. No, we need models to specify assumptions, and to make them operational in, say, an experiment, but that is at best the opening gambit. We use the models to challenge and thus improve the quality of ecological narrative. For a nuanced description of quality see Pirsig (1992). An improved, higher-quality narrative is the point. 

No privileged level of mechanism

Where does metaphor or analogy live?

Models are so tightly prescribed that you can think of them as degenerate narratives. Models and experiments are contrived to remove as much semantic uncertainty as possible, whereas proper narratives are semantically rich. Proper narratives leave room for alternative interpretations, even though they describe the same situation

The nub of an essence is that it is the target of our understanding of biological systems. We use models and eventually narratives to construct understanding of essences in an observer. Essences are the causes of what makes things equivalent in an equivalence class. Much as what is seen in an observation cannot be completely independent of arbitrary observation protocols; essences are the context of models but do not exist independent of the model for equivalence in the equivalence class in question.

Unfortunately for the modernist view, both particles and waves are indicated by the slot experiment. In that experiment, individual electron hits on a screen (implying particle) accumulate to make a wave-interference pattern (implying wave) but only if a second slot is open. So, did the electron that made the hit split and go through both slots, or did it go though only one slot, somehow "knowing" that the other slot was open? Neither option is appealing. We seem to need both wave dynamics and particle structure to explain what we see, even if they play contradictory roles in explaining what we see. The trick is to abandon a unified view and accept a complementarity one in which electrons are both waves and particles, but that keeps the notions separate to avoid contradiction. 

Pattee (1978) raises the issue of complementarity in social and biological science. The harder science presses its models and data, the more often the issue of duality comes to the fore. He recommends dealing with the contradictions in duality by recognizing that two separate descriptions appear to be necessary. One description is law based, by which he means an account of the situation in dynamic terms as to what is possible. The other description is rule based and reflects what is allowed by the arbitrarily asserted names and structures, given that a self-assertive 
observer must be part of any observation. 

Narrative rises above models to deal with true complexity. Rosen (2000) says that a system is complex if you cannot write a model for it. He has said in several places that if you cannot write a single model that accounts for the system as experienced, then it is complex. With complementarity tied inexorably into the essence, you indeed cannot write a single model. Furthermore, this is a statement coming from principles, not local exigencies. Simple systems rely on laws and structures to inform the model. But complexity runs and hides in the essence. One cannot model your way there to get predictions, but one can tell stories about it. Analogy and narratives are vehicles for you to take responsibility in the process that allows science to work. Analogy and narrative are indeed the point of it all. 

As we expand the ideas of model, analogy, and narrative in the body of this chapter, we will quickly define what we mean because our usage is quite specific. Mechanism gets a longer treatment because it is likely to be taken for granted by the audience we wish to influence. Analogy identifies equivalence between two systems on the basis of some characteristics, actively ignoring the large number of non-equivalences that also pertain. 

### Learning from Seymour Papert - MIT YouTube video

Marvin Minski

I remember thread some gadget I was making that kept falling apart - Claude said its as easy as pushing a string. My memory is that Claude never talked very much but everything he said would echo in your head for 3 or 4 days and start a whole new train of thought because it was a way of looking at something that seemed completely wrong at first but then gradually you would see he had a point. (Minksy on Claude Shannon - learning from Seymour Papert)

It took the genius of Charles Gauss to provide the basis of differential geometry equations but what Papert did was to grasp the essence of the theory and another genius Seymour was able to contextualise the important ideas in this for the child's world. use the power of digital computing to provide the context for the understanding of differential equations in the child's world. The reason he was able to do this are that there special things about the computer that allow a different way of looking at these differential relationships to be put incremental movement of the child's movement into the child's world and so it became understandable (echoes here of Einstein's development of relativity by sitting on a train and viewing the station railway clock) (Alan Kay).

"You can't think about thinking unless you think about thinking about something" Papert quoted by Negroponte.


Engineers are sculptures of ideas, it is what they take away and they manipulate/work with the pile of rubble that makes up the block of marble from the artwork.

### Manufactured Complexity
So much of our dealing with complexity is because we start with the wrong point of view, we kludge to address the material inadequacies of our representation.

It is a manufactured complexity by ourselves.

We hold on to some wonderful theory or other which fails to fit with reality and we add kludges to support the theory rather than hunt for a new perspectives that allows a different theory. Mathematics is replete with this behaviour of where a simple, alternative perspective, dissolves the challenge of the situation. For example when asked 'how many ball would a knock-out tournament require if each match requires a new ball' many would start with the number of rounds, special consideration for odd and even and so on. The better answer is to suggest that each loser takes the ball.

### Poly Crisis or Poly Causal

[Graham Berrisford](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7243551940083597312/#)

I am intrigued by your 'bow-tie' model of causality.

In the first week of my first job in the labs at a Petrochemical company we were shown a fictional safety video about a lab fire - the point of the video was to demonstrate that everyone was responsible. Was it the supplier who used flammable packing, was it the lab manager who left the discarded packing in a pile, was it the lab technician who used a large quantity [Winchester] of a flammable liquid or was it the victim of the fire who lit a cigarette? The message was that safety (ie causality) and with it responsibility was dispersed and multi-factorial.

At the same time some of my fellow Systems Thinkers were also learning about causality by reading Fabian Society leaflets on Marxism, This told a convenient fiction of a single cause and source of everything bad (capitalism) - a popular theme for those aiming to duck any responsibility.

Politics all too often relies on this fiction of a single reason for events, the tie in your bow tie.

When we discuss the climate crisis do we look to the single cause of the last breath of the fabled flapping butterfly or the evils of big oil? At least Thomas Sowell tries a more nuanced and truthful understanding.

### Beer - Culpabliss Error


We talk all the time about systems, but the systemic attributes of the system are not represented in our descriptions. The notion of a system in the public mind is quite static...My complaint is that a root cause of our present discontents has to do with the reductive character of scientific explanation, and a resulting epistemology that regards consequences as inherent qualities of static systems. For a second time I risk having a diagnosis perceived as fictitious

I draw your attention to a second root cause, which has to do with the kinds of models that we use in managing our world. I am speaking quite simply about the image of something that we hold in our minds - the idea we have selected from a myriad sensory impression, endowed with coherence, and elected to call “reality”.

If the models we use are so inept, and if our decisions are therefore so defective, how has this mismatch come about? What we call 'progress' turns out to be a recognition of advances in technique, and has little to do with advance in understanding. In short, we have become very good at following our technological nose - regardless of where we shall end up. But understanding is a product of modelling, and the useful models change very little over the millennia. Of course, and because we believe in progress, we disregard early statements of crucial models. This is technological hubris, and I believe that it should be abandoned. It seems to me that the crucial models arise from experience as mediated by a central processor - the brain - which has not changed in millennia, and that therefore understanding is timeless. Thanks to fads in the usage of technology, this does not look to be the case. Thanks to fads in the language of philosophy, this does not sound to be the case. But it is the case.

 in each case a decision is taken or a decision is neglected with unacknowledged but perfectly predictable consequences. These consequences are disguised by the models in use: the consequences are not apparent in the surrogate worlds generated and supported by those models.  


### Social Justice

Lucky white men - such a paradigm busting innovation can only be discovered once and those that make the breakthrough whilst exceptional may be no more exceptional than others who follow but who cannot be first. Also this discussion is on novelty in the present era (it may have been discovered earlier by the invention has been forgotten) and the effects of the society/media in announcing and publicising the breakthrough (even the famous, eg Darwin, have contested histories that others came up with the idea first, and of course the role of Rosalind Franklin). Many other example exist, for example Srinvasa Ramanujan in mathematics is an exception because the wherewithal to bring about the breakthrough existed in 'non predominantly-white' societies.

I would argue with the meme that the 'West got rich' and suggest some individuals got rich and some (many/most) of those individuals lived in the West. As far as I know none of my predecessors, as a stale-white-man, were rich relative to their contemporaries, indeed in the great depression my grandfathers firm formed after the war was bankrupt and maintained only by the work of my uncle who wrecked his health in the process. At the same time a few individuals in 'the colonies' and, at home, were far richer. 

In normal commerce we broadly accept that the price is whatever people are prepared to pay. However in the revisionist history the question is "Did the West get rich by paying too little for raw materials from colonies?" - given that the demand came exclusively from industries developed in the West the question is who else could have paid and who could have paid more?. In the trading posts of North America we can today balk at swapping buttons for seal skins but I presume the Eskimos had a surplus of skins and the traders a surplus of buttons.

The Environmental Fallacy in System Design  
  
Pages 4-5 from this wonderful book.  The Systems Approach and its Enemies
  
The simplistic approach to system design says that there is a clear and urgent need to change something about our systems, otherwise we will perish: we need to create more resources of food and energy, we need to reduce air and water pollution, we need to reduce our population – otherwise no environment will sustain us. The other approach is that we must first of all think through the consequences of each proposed action, otherwise the "clear and urgent need" will lead us down the road to disaster: we create more arable land and irretrievably destroy its future productivity, we eliminate water pollution by passing laws that prohibit industry in impoverished areas, we try to Stop population growth by attacking deep-rooted religions and cultural values. ...  
  
... The present fallacy can be described as an "environmental error"; you could also call it the "error of ignoring the environment", but this designation does not have anywhere near the impact of the simpler ones. One form of environmental fallacy is to observe that x is growing (or decreasing) in ways that are dangerous, harmful, or potentially catastrophic. Typically, a critical point is identified as definitely unsafe, really harmful, or catastrophic. Based on these observations, an imperative is generated, usually either legal or technological. The imperative has the form "Prevent x from growing." If x is alcohol consumption, then the (deceptive) imperative is, "Stop drinking alcohol by making it illegal," and we have prohibition, the most dangerous deceptive law designed to overcome the dangers of drinking. And of course, we never learn from our experiences. X is now the use of marijuana: X is growing, the growth of X is dangerous and "therefore" it is "unavoidable" to ban the use of marijuana. ...  
  
... Deceptive, all too deceptive. Why?  
  
💡 Because within the framework of the systems approach, no problem can simply be solved on its own basis.  
  
Every problem has an "environment" with which it is inextricably linked. If you stop the growth (or decline) of x, you will also make other things grow (or decrease), and these changes you cause can be just as severe and devastating as the growth of x.
