In addition to the impact of the observer there is a fundamental difference between notions of the complicated etc and the complex. 

### The Peculiar Notion of Abstraction

Ideas around complexity are locked into an abstraction built around a common set of principles/behaviours and corresponding there is no absolutism - no unitary definition or categorical right or wrong as to what is complexity.

It is an odd situation and a platform for circular arguments (as evident in LinkedIn) around the central dogma of 'are complex systems real' - of which the short answer is no, and yes the properties exhibited by complex systems are real.

If you are interested Richard Feynman explains the analogous situation in our understanding of energy - a topic I think we all claim to understand 'as real'

"There is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in the manifold changes which nature undergoes. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same. It is an abstract thing in that it does not tell us the mechanism or the reasons for the various formulas". (Feynman - Lectures in Physics)
### The Next Level of Complexity

If as we state there is no mechanism or reason for Complexity as a whole there are specific mechanisms for specific (types of) Complexity. If I start with the Physical in some cases I can identify the specific structural coupling whose form modifies the properties of the parts introduces the new emergent properties of the whole - my best example here is of the metronomes [Spontaneous Synchronization | UCLA Physics & Astronomy](https://demoweb.physics.ucla.edu/content/spontaneous-synchronization).

[Spontaneous Synchornisation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T58lGKREubo)

In Nelson's terms I have used a specific Ultimate Particular to qualify an abstract Phenomenon. At this point in my thinking there is a unitary mechanism, however involved, which builds an explanation. However any explanation lies not in the broad abstraction as Complex but in a specific narrower instance of this.

![[Media/universal to ultimate particular.png]]

The distinction between Complexity and Complication etc is that the former envisages is a group abstraction the latter studies a specific case. No general mechanism exists for the Complex and a specific mechanism exists for the Complicated - however difficult it is to identify the mechanism underlying instances of either concept.

In other types of Complexity, such as biological Complexity, the mechanism (or cause) may be manifest differently at different levels of structure. In such cases there is a compound confounding factor in our study - the challenge of mapping which aspect of structure matches which element of emergence. Here pin-pointing a specific Ultimate Particular generates many subsidiary questions. Further as we approach the 'Wicked Problem' limit of the situation in question the whole enquiry process dissolves into a circular paradox. 

At base there is the siren appeal of the general simplicity for Complex Systems which is an allure which makes us victim of Reification and all the problems and frustrations this brings.

### The Metronome Example
I use the metronome example as my 'reference case' when thinking about the phenomenon of Complexity because it reminds me of the universal principles required in the dissolution of Complexity and the way in which simple mechanisms can do away with the notions of mysticism when confronted with Complex behaviours.

The starting point is simply to watch the video - at [Spontaneous Synchronization | UCLA Physics & Astronomy](https://demoweb.physics.ucla.edu/content/spontaneous-synchronization). ![[Media/Metronome synchronisation.PNG]]

Now, if you follow me, I can explain how this simple demonstration reveals much of the underlying principles discussed under Complexity. 

- Starting with a **Systems Thinking stance** we can separate out the **whole and the parts** of the system. The whole demonstrates a composite behaviour - synchronisation - which is **derived from, by different to the, behaviour of the parts** (the individual metronomes). This is an **emergent property**.
- The whole includes the supporting plank, the coke tins and the hard surface on which it is placed. Generally we might assume these to be inconsequential static aspects of the assembly but here they play an important part, The **synchronisation would not occur if the hard surface was replaced with a carpet** (which increases the rolling friction). Imagine that - the synchronisation of all the metronomes has as a control variable which is the friction of the supporting surface. This is why identifying and re-**considering the position of the boundary is so critical**.
- The individual metronomes are engineered to keep a steady beat yet here the whole transcends these behaviours. This is a common feature of the **emergent properties of a complex system, we observe the characteristics of the part remain but are transcended by way of being amplified, suppressed, transformed, cohered etc** etc. It is not the notion of magic 'something for nothing' rather it is a channelling of the intrinsic behaviours of the parts in transformative ways.
- The **emergent behaviours** are evidently driven by the coupling between the individual metronomes, the **phenomenon lies in their interrelationships moderated by the structural configuration**. In the grand scale of the energetics the energy use of the primary purpose of the metronome, the swinging of the pendulum, dwarfs the vibration losses through the base yet it is these 'minor vibrations' which ultimately dwarf and control the pendulum swings as the system comes to synchronization. The interesting **phenomena comes through the interrelationships between elements even if these are many orders of magnitude less** than the forces contained within each element.
- What we observe is the innovative essence of engineering. Faced with the problem "how to get a group of metronomes to synchronise" **many would start in the process of reductionism, a disassembly of the parts and ever more complex (and futile) linkages to ensure they all start together**. Here we have a **dynamic post-hoc approach** which exploits minor asymmetries in the parts to coordinate the whole- the **'defects' are used as the means of perfection**. How many engineers would suggest this - put them on a hard surface with a free rolling support and they will look after themselves?
- Drilling deeper into why the metronomes synchronise is to realise there is **no need for fanciful thinking** such as to invoke a distortion of the space time continuum **or the need for other speculations**. It is to recognise what every child on a swing learns that to adjust your centre of gravity in the swing does work against gravity and changes momentum. The individual metronomes **continue to obey the grand laws of physics** but just respond to the micro-gravity changes in the rocking platform. 
- As an example of the group phenomenon characteritics of Complexity Adaptive Systems we can recognise *emergent property*, *strange attractors* (the metronome on the right), *non-linearity*, *dynamic behaviour*, *co-evolution*, *adaptive nature* (taking for example the list of Patton) history dependence, specific configuration and [list of complex behaviours] yet our example is derived from a specific transparent example. To recognise **the mechanism requires the specific example but we may associate and abstract to more general cases by identifying the principles** evident in the example - such as boundary setting, interrelationships, structural coupling, transcendent behaviours.
- The specificity of the phenomenon is not just the asymmetry of the parts or the composition but in the **detail of the configuration** such as the distance between the metronomes and the magnitude of the judder as the pendulum changes direction, the video shows **a specific configuration which resonates around the signature frequency of the assembly**. This Complex behaviour relies on the resonant coherence of the forces and the tolerance of the system to accommodate these without excessive dampening or amplification. If the supporting surface was 'completely smooth' the phenomenon would not exist. It is a demonstration of the **sensitivity to starting conditions**.
- Watching the video a second or third time and you begin to **appreciate the stages of our own sensemaking**. It begins with confusion where everything is different, then slowly you see the pattern as the synchronisation emerges from the right, then as the metronomes fall into line it confirms that it is no longer a fluke. Then you start to look for and appreciate the mechanism! In this process **the system apparently transforms from chaotic, to complex** even to simple but **the transformation is not of the system but of our growing interpretation of the accumulating evidence**.

In presenting 
my example of the metronomes I am not suggesting that it is, by itself, an explanation of all of Complexity. It is a useful place to start as a set of principles which in many cases provide a complete explanation and in others are a lodestone of what else to look for.

### The Route to Wicked

The conceptualisation of the limits of thinking is most popularly summarised by Rittell and 
- the ever more divergent and incompatible consequentials of approximations (the Kay argument)
- the limits (left to right) of pure reductionism as a complete explanation
- the spotlight metaphor - of overlapping and ever apparent colours
- the introduction of levels - which are confounding in our understanding and conflicting in decision making
- the ubiquitous (iron law) of the energy source and the replacement as a useful generalisation [words middle relationship]
- the degree of entanglement between the principles - cause & effect, function and structure, 

#### What Rittel teaches us
 Rittel introduced several fundamental ideas: 
 
- Simple problems (problems which are already defined) are easy to solve, because defining a problem inherently defines a solution.
- The definition of a problem is subjective; it comes from a point of view. Thus, when defining problems, all stake-holders, experts, and designers are equally knowledgeable (or unknowledgeable).
- Some problems cannot be solved, because stake-holders cannot agree on the definition. These problems are called wicked, but sometimes they can be tamed.
- Solving simple problems may lead to improvementâ€”but not innovation. For innovation, we need to re-frame wicked problems.
- Because one person cannot possibly remember or keep track of all the variables (of both existing and desired states) in a wicked problem, taming wicked problems requires many people.
- These people have to talk to each other; they have to deliberate; they have to argue.
- To tame a wicked problem, they have to agree on goals and actions for reaching them. This requires knowledge about actions, not just facts.
- Science is concerned with factual knowledge (what-is); design is concerned with instrumental knowledge (how what-is relates to what-ought-to-be), how actions can meet goals.
- The process of argumentation is the key and perhaps the only method of taming wicked problems.
- This process is political.
- Design is political. 
## Complexity - A Simplicity Too Far
Making the point that abstraction is a simplification of reality which becomes manifest as the specific detail is suppressed, taking this too far essential detail may be eliminated in the process.

### The General and the Particular

The with reductionism is that it allows a general approach to identify particular/specific explanations. The allure of complexity is that it offer the prospect/allows a specific approach to identify general explanations. The flaw in this logic is that the sphere of Complexity is more complex than this simple explanation of a 1 to many relationship. 
#### Factors

The properties of the parts are an observation, but the observation may only e valid in the [empty world] simon limit or in the pure [unadulterated] limit
Forces - produce an abstract but common influence on behaviours
Complex - is a class of behaviours (effect) not a class of mechanisms (causes)
Complexity - as an abstract concept - may arise from the [structure], the [levels] ie ecological or the [social] ie opinion
A problem is a misfit which depends on the observer both as a source of the [evidence] for the misfit and the [judgment] of the [significance/importance?] of the deviation (compared with what?). There are different [standards] that can be applied - standards of taste, of ethics, of aesthetics, of external knowledge (eg engineering).

#### Ladder

Essence - is a perspective derived from a constellation of perspectives/phenomena
Narrative - is a collection of misfits - made coherent and multiplexed by a common assembly
Model - is a true representation of some misfit generated by abstraction, it is type of phenomenon
Mechanism - is the cause and is the consequence of the forces of alignment, it is the nature of the phenomenon 

[distinction between of kind or of type]

#### Engineering

Where do engineering concepts (such as tolerance) fit in a theory of complexity
The spectrum of tame to wicked problems
Constraints are an observer /behavioural construct
Engineering principles are a structural/assembly construct
Type/kinds are a classification/simplification/socialisation construct [bandwidth of brain]
Mechanism is a causal construct

#### Logic Tree

(subject to) i.e. what is there
observer > behaviours > structure > parts > forces

(imposes) i.e. what is subject to deliberate change
Observer > standards > configurations > substitutions > state (time and scale)

gap - between behaviours and standards
architecture - between structures and configurations
[catalysis?] - between parts and components
[agitation, equilibrium?] - between forces and state




Critical Realism may progress the argument that the [?] but it only provides the partial closure [final answer] suggested by [Kay] and [Rittel] - as an approach to wicked problems it may be a simplification too far
The acid test is that if the residual concerns are of a magnitude or significance commensurate with the original concern the problem is a misfit

Quoting the [wikiman - sutherland review of beer] we are ; not to deny mysticism but to demystify to the greatest possible extent, we want to strip the mysticism of any lack of understanding or failure to appreciate the existing possibilities. We ask "Why resort to a (speculative) possibility when any existing (substantiated) probability will do"

We can all recognise the visceral pressure that a lack of options brings [hemmed in] but the escape route most probably exists in what is known without an appeal to what is not 

It might be valuable to think about Complexity, it is a description of many different systems which display a common pattern of behaviours. Unlike Reductionism - which is a general method to illuminate specific behaviours - Complexity cannot be considered as a specific method to explain general behaviours! There is no common cause.

We can talk about an average family of 2.4 children. Although this is useful as an abstract formulation for a group of families there are no instances of such a family. We see the same paradox with complexity. [Dave Snowden](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/?highlightedUpdateType=COMMENTS_BY_YOUR_NETWORK&highlightedUpdateUrn=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7222496446049120256#) asks a great question on bees but specific causes (and observational stances) bring the phenomenon - see Herb Simons parable of the ant trail on the beach [complex to an observer, simple to the ant!].

I understand your desire to formulate a 'rule of constraints' (one complex, three unstable) but this is simply a phenomenon of a dimension reduction. If you know Principal Component Analysis for example 'anything' can be reduced to one variable but you have to pay attention to the residuals. If the residuals are significant it is multi-dimensional and if the residuals are unbounded the problem is a wicked problem.

Sadly TOC is not a universal explanation of complexity

### Simple Complexity and Complex Complexity 

Once we can view the hallmark behaviours/patterns of Complexity in a relatively simple system, with a direct physical cause (albeit convoluted) the question arises as to whether more complex conditions of complexity are fundamentally different in operation or whether additional conditions simply obscure the simpler type of explanation. It is important because in the study of complexity are the themes and the simple case mechanism applicable widely - it helps us to know where to look.  

#### The Confusion of Levels

There are many structural and logistic reasons as to why hierarchical structures are so prevalent in the natural world. The hierarchy confuses the identification of the parts - do we include sub-assemblies simply as a 'part' or is the situation such that we need to 'drill down' to expose further properties needed to explain the whole. 

Allen uses a time and scale 'slicing' to recognise characteristic levels

> The above characteristics that we used to define complexity are in fact what one does to a system that is undefined so that it can be assigned to the class of simple things. In a sense this turns the standard expert approach to hierarchy and complexity on its head. The characteristics that are normally assigned to something complex are in fact how one makes it simple (Fig. 1). Ironically, the standard definitions of complexity are in fact characteristics of a system that has been defined into simplicity. In return for our sacrifice, this turnaround gives us something, that is operational when complexity itself blunts other lines of attack. It is this relationship to simplicity, more than any other reason, that demands a sophisticated epistemology going beyond realist, metaphysical assertions as to material nature and external reality. Before simplicity there is complexity, and the characteristics that we mistook for complexity heretofore are in fact descriptions of systems made simple. A telling observation in computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) is that, once it works, it is not AI anymore. Once complexity is made workable, it is no longer complex. The characteristics conventionally ascribed to complexity are precisely not about complexity per se. (Allen)

It is rather convoluted but in essence Allen identifies that embedded in the system is an architecture which, once determined, provides an explanation of the behaviour and renders it epistemologically simple. Once the observer has 'locked in' to this simplicity the next step is to try and recognise the cause of the key behaviours in order to intervene, this is the identification of constraints.

The epistemic/phenomenological basis of this quest for constraints is often haphazard and makes a strong dependence of suitable metaphors [abduction etc] the issue is that without constraints the identification of constraints introduces any number of specious and erroneous assertions. It is a very noisy process.

In the enthusiasm for mathematical explanations the 'standard' approach was one of isomorphism to a specific mathematical formulation, it is more than a transformation of the physical situation and it transcends many of the logical and physical 'laws' that describe and prescribe the physical situation. It is at once a powerful, seductive and deceiving step. 

#### What is Architecture
An abstract set of principles - the engineering of the abstract

### Why do Possibilities Increase over Time?

- Evolution introduces extra parts
- Stochasticity - eventually you hit the rare combinations
- Entropy development - removes the ordered entities which may inhibit some possibilities
- Speciation - new species
- Stochastic conditions - produce niches
- Goal-nessing - eventually the goals are achieved
- Juxtaposition of conditions - the right mutation in the right niche for novelty
- Evolution - tick of the clock

It may be there is not a continuous increase but on a different scale it may be an increase/decrease fluctuation (up & downs)

Can an apex predator make a species extinct?
Is species extinction a unique event - or simply the warp and weft of the evolution process (ie nature is not precious about each species - easy come easy go)
- Species may by a consequence of the parts - e.g. grass eating
- Species may be by virtue of the whole - e.g. architecture and configuration

In a competitive environment - there is a battle between the time in which ...
- Adaption - a complex component builds its defences versus
- Niche-ism - a more primitive / simple part can consolidate its advantage 

Leads to fit, form and function - a recursive relationship linking the levels of a hierarchical structure. 
- fit - the instrumental judgment (the levels)
- form - the value judgement (the structure)
- function - the fact judgment (the parts)
