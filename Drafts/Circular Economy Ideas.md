Systems Thinking

### Interrelationships, Perspectives, Boundaries



### Time, Scale, Scope

Dealing with the multiplicities of the situation:-

Do we have a resource based view of the challenges? - What do we need?
Do we have an agency based view of the situation? - Who do we need?
Do we have a perspective based view of the situation? - How do we need?



Do you have a clear image of time?

Should we think about time scales - 
1. cycle - brake linings
2. product - brakes
3. components - nuts and bolts
4. compounds - iron and steel
5. minerals - 

Each 'upward' transformation, such as mining, has a logistics and value chain which currently operates 'autonomously' moderated only by market economics and demand constraints (example of CO2 production and energy costs).

### Beyond SD

There is a simpler stance regarding Systems Thinking (ST) which focus back on the OU axes of interrelationships-boundaries-perspectives

In a circular economy (CE) our natural stance is formed around things and exclusive vertical supply chains. Nature achieves better CE result from a scrum of different entities and specifically multiple relationships (competitive, cooperative, symbiotic). 

we need to focus less on things more on interrelationships

Carls value thinking requires different perspectives - value is in the eye of the beholder.

we need a ST approach which considers and synthesises different perspectives

Nature operates at many levels - Allen has a good paper on narrative scale and scope. This depends critically on the boundary conditions

we need a ST approach which recognises and uses boundaries & levels

QED SD not a good candidate

## DSRP

We hold that DSRP is the essence of systems thinking: four cognitive patterns that are universal to our various subfields and methods, but more generally to human thought. DSRP involves distinctions, systems, relationships, and perspectives. Distinctions can be made between and among things and ideas; things and ideas can be organized into systems, in which both the parts and the wholes can be identified; relationships can be made between and among things and ideas; and lastly, things and ideas can be viewed from the perspectives of other people, things and ideas (Cabrera et al, 2015, p. 535).

## Systems Thinking

… systems thinking as a field is often described as transdisciplinary because its ideas can be applied across several disciplines (e.g. Francois, 2006; Rousseau and Wilby, 2014; Mingers, 2015), much as statistics can be. It includes a vast body of theory, methodology and practice, ranging from systems philosophy to methods for systemic inquiry and intervention.
It can best be described as the application of systems concepts to frame our understanding of the world, and it is also about possible future action – what ought to be or could be (Ackoff, 1981; Checkland, 1981; Ulrich, 1983; Midgley, 2000; Cabrera et al, 2008, 2015).

## Allen on Models
*In modem day toxicology, problems arise in modeling complex ecosystems, such the Columbia River system*. There remain an abundance of models for which responsibility of assumptions is unaccounted and between which cohesion lacks. Models should be evaluated independently, taking into mind issues of scale and type in order to make sure the models actively change in accordance with the adaptive system they try to represent. The authors here suggest using narratives to weave together the inconsistent models. Narratives allow scientists to take responsibility for their assumptions and facilitate improved coherence between models. Problem solving engines, such as soft systems methodology, may then be used to achieve these modelling and adaptive management goals. 

**Strategic Options Development (SODA)** is a framework to design problem solving interventions for messy problems. It involves the development of a facilitated model that is politically feasible and shows the ***interconnectedness*** between issues, problems, strategies, and options.

**SSM** is a highly participative method to address problems in systems through exploring participants’ ***perceptions*** about them which lead to a model of a desirable future system of activities.

**SD** models can be quantitative or qualitative depending on the objective of its use: understanding the structure or simulating its behavior, respectively.

**Viable System Model (VSM)** facilitates seeing organizations as complex communications systems that control bureaucracies, hierarchies, and functional structures.

**Systemic Intervention (SI)** is also a pluralistic approach that provides a rationale combining, mostly ST methods to question the ***boundaries*** defined in systems before addressing the problems in the system.
### The significance of boundaries
 
 >For Churchman, “boundaries are social or personal constructs that define the limits of the knowledge that is to be taken as pertinent in an analysis”

Our language and our thinking is infused with the concept of value chains and the hegemony of organisations, the industrial revolution began with vertically integrated value chains (Ford owned rubber plantations in Malaysia). Whilst economics has fragmented these value chains into a small number of strategic operatives and alliances nonetheless the dominant architecture reflects this vertical architecture. Commodities and infrastructure forms take a broad horizontal slice for utility services nevertheless significant vertical industry specialisations remain.

Our fluency with vertical structure carries over to our default conceptualisation of situations and the systems which underpin our imagination, we tend to think in terms of things as opposed to a stance that makes relationships the paramount aspect with entities and their organisational units as the focus. 

If we look towards nature as a model there is no such fixed alignment, different species participate in different parts of each thermodynamic or resource chain. In some cases the species compete and in others they cooperate or engage in a symbiotic relationship. 

### The importance of perspectives

The issue is that many prospects for sustainability rely on behaviour modification 

### Narratives

In modem day toxicology, problems arise in modeling complex ecosystems, such as the Columbia River system. There remain an abundance of models for which responsibility of assumptions is unaccounted and between which cohesion lacks. Models should be evaluated independently, taking into mind issues of scale and type in order to make sure the models actively change in accordance with the adaptive system they try to represent. The authors here suggested using narratives to weave together the inconsistent models. Narratives allow scientists to take responsibility for their assumptions and facilitate improved coherence between models.
Problem solving engines, such as soft systems methodology, may then be used to achieve these modeling and adaptive management goals. 

## A Protocol for Consistent Narrative 

Allen (in press) develop a framework that interrelates a series of general systems notions, such that the activities of the observer as scientist or manager are well characterized. When an observer notices an entity, therein arise the criteria for scale and type, intuitively at first, but soon explicitly. The type is a class that identifies the critical issues as to how the entity is defined. Rosen (2000) refers to equivalence classes, where the point of interest is what is the correspondence across the class between members. The class to which the entity is assigned gives a defining type to the observed entity. In a reciprocal consideration, the entity is checked by the scientist or manager for membership of the class. This check might be as to whether or not the species in question belongs to the class “endangered species.” This cycle of definition and verification improves the model that derives from the equivalence class. Choosing the definition of the class offers general criterion for type, whereas the actual structure of the individual entity meets concretely that general criterion (Figure 1). 

Science and adaptive management proceed by achieving a dynamic definition of the equivalence class. Modifying the equivalence class keeps science and management alive to change. Once the entity under observation has been assigned to its type, it can be generalized by challenging the type with some other entity that should fit the class, but may not. For example, having found a species that is susceptible to a toxic material, one could challenge the class by verifying that some related species responds to the poison in the same way. If birds suffer reproductive problems from the presence of organochlorines in the environment, then one might challenge the equivalence class with mammals or fish to see if they too are members of the susceptible class responding with reproductive issues.
 
‘The cycle of definition and verification plays upon type generally associated with the but it also moves through a concrete example of a type. The same tension between the general and the specific occurs in the issue of scale. In order to see the members of the equivalence class, a protocol for measurement is created, at least implicitly. That is whence comes the general case of scale. Class defined by type is scale-independent, The class organism does not denote a collection of objects of a certain size in principle. On the other hand, when one finds a particular organism, it is indeed an object with certain dimensions. The size of the particular item is the local, concrete expression of scale. ‘The issue of scale and type in principle should not be confused with the scale and type of an example. 

Related to the difference between scale and type, Ahl and Allen (1996) make much of the distinction between level of observation as opposed to level of organization. Levels of observation are ordered on scaling principles, and have nothing to do with type. The type of thing one sees has nothing much to do with the scaling of the devices for observation or the size of any particular example. When textbooks organize all of biology in a grand hierarchical scheme, they refer to levels of organization, when in fact they mean levels that are ordered by scale, not type.



Different world views yield different models, and the argument typically then shifts to “what is the right model?” when a more useful question is “which is the more powerful narrative?” We have shown how narratives allow us to qualitatively interrelate formal models. Formal models help us explore relationships between data, but do not always lead us back to improving and enriching the original narrative. To critically assess risk to a complex system, humans within the system must adaptively weave a continuous narrative  about that systems’ current functional states, and seek consensus on management goals leading to future desired states.
