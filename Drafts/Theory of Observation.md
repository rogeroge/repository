Hierarchy Theory is a theory of observation that can be used to systematically define a researcher’s perspective. It is an approach for modelling complex systems ‘through a self reflective process of observation and description’ (Wilby, 1994, p. 659). It gives us some tools to explicitly describe the perspective of the researcher and the researcher’s role. These tools enable us to triangulate between the research project system and components like the candidate conceptual systems, the research objectives, external stake holders, external theory, different empirical domains and other research projects. ‘Hierarchy theory’s method is to expand the problem space to include the observer as well as the observed’ (Ahl and Allen, 1996, p. 28). It enables the pre conceptions, metaphors, values, interests, external theories and experience of the researcher to be examined as part of the research strategy. Hierarchy Theory addresses how ‘observation is the interface between perception and learning’ (ibid., p. 13). Observation, and research, require not just seeing but looking. Knowledge does not come from the observer and it does not come from the external world. Knowledge comes from an interaction of the two. This assertion is consistent with Weick’s segmentation of experience (1989) and Tsoukas’ Homomorphic mappings (1991). Research depends on the many important design decisions that the researcher makes and these in turn depend upon the researcher’s values and experience. Next, we use an aspect of Hierarchy Theory to examine the validation and empirical research stages of theory construction by considering how the researcher observes the conceptual system that makes up a possible theory as well as any empirical phenomena

It is particularly important to distinguish substantial from semantic arguments. Semantic arguments come from limited ability on the part of the researcher. By defining levels and spelling out relationships, Hierarchy theory can whittle away ambiguity. The answer to many questions in a complex arena is ‘It depends.’ Stubbornly insisting on a single outcome in such situations leads to giving privilege to one level of analysis arbitrarily. Levels of analysis are not externally true; they are to be chosen carefully, taking responsibility for the choices. Semantic argument arises from reifying arbitrary choices. These limitations must be acknowledged in order to improve theoretical quality. In the process of theory generation and testing, all stages are strongly subject to the researcher’s interests, focus, experience, values, chosen methodologies and priorities. These both limit and enable the conceptual scope and content of any conceptual systems that the research may generate or test. So theorists advocate the use of devices to improve the variety of input concepts and structural relations (Weick, 1989; Tsoukas, 1991; Lewis and Grimes, 1999; Robson, 2002; Ketokivi and Mantere, 2010). The conceptual system that constitutes a theory can only map on to an abstraction of the complex phenomena being investigated. Thus, the potential for researcher bias is inherent in theory building because the researcher must choose which aspect of the phenomena to abstract from an infinite number of possible aspects.

Theory construction can be thought of as a process within a process. The theory construction meta process involves frequent switching between examining candidate conceptual systems, their conceptual elements and their interrelationships as well as examining empirical data. Hierarchy Theory makes a distinction between definitional frameworks and empirical frameworks.
Definitional frameworks are systems of categorization that are set by the observer and empirical frameworks are systems of categorization that patterned on what is observed. Definitional frameworks are based on what is important to the observer and empirical frameworks reflect the phenomena that are observed. 
Problems arise when definitional frame works are confused with empirical frameworks and this confusion can happen in theorization as much as in empirical study. We can best use metaphors and other transdisciplinary concepts, such as a researcher’s preconceptions and observation frameworks, by articulating them and by assessing them as part of systematic internal and external triangulation process. This includes specifying the research question and all other parts of the research process to check for consistency. 
This is consistent with Lewis and Grimes (1999) work on using multiple paradigms because both deal with using multiple ‘perspectives’ that take the form of underlying theoretical concepts which can inform different stages of the research process. The differences between Lewis and Grimes’ theory-building strategy and our model are that they emphasize how and why researchers should use multiple paradigm sources in theory building and that we emphasize why it works based on how observers observe complex systems, such as in the system of the research project, which includes the observer. 
We emphasize the distinction between empirical and definitional frame works of observation. Observation, measurement and research itself is co-produced by the observer and the observed. The researcher makes ‘creative leaps’ (Mintzberg, 1979, p. 584) and uses ‘disciplined imagination’ (Weick, 1989, p. 516) to construct definitional frameworks of observation. The observer knowingly and through bias selects which aspects of the observed to sense phenomena. Lewis and Grimes suggest using alternative perspectives in the form of different research paradigms to better judge any single perspective. 
We do the same, but we also make the point that there are more perspectives out there than are held by all other researchers and their paradigms. **The nature of a complex system is that it can be analysed from more perspectives than observers are able to observe from**. In theory building especially this applies to ‘theoretical observation’, i.e. choosing which concepts to use as well as to observing physical phenomena. The perspective of each researcher is relevant to the qualitative theory construction phases and the quantitative theory validation phases of research. A process of theory construction that includes the perceptions and roles of researchers is also useful when external metaphors and internal preconceptions are kept to a minimum, e.g. when using Grounded Theory (Ketokivi and Mantere, 2010). 
These perceptions govern how researchers relate to the conceptual system that emerges as they try to make sense of the observed phenomena. This is true whether or not the conceptual system has transdisciplinary components from sources other than the observed phenomena or not. The values and experience of the researcher inform all stages of the theory construction process. Tsoukas uses the guiding principle of ‘systematicity’ and he advocates the preservation of higher order relations, i.e. abstraction (1991). But Tsoukas does not explicitly explain what he means by higher ‘order’ and what he means by ‘lower’ order. Except to suggest that high order relations would be important and are very often associated with the cause and sustenance of the mechanisms of the phenomenon of interest. 
Researchers’ values and experiences define what higher and lower order relations are. These ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ limits are a product of each researcher rather than what is researched. Their values and experiences are ‘parallel’, i.e. each idea that they suggest does not necessarily exclude other ideas. This means that the cog-in-a cog model can be used in reverse as well. It is not solely for using input concepts as building blocks for candidate conceptual systems in one direction. But it can also be used in reverse to use problems to suggest metaphorical bridges to candidate conceptual systems that could then help to theorize them. It may even be possible to ‘reverse-engineer’ existing theory to look for unrecognized features. 
Selection between possible candidate conceptual systems always involves prioritization and filtering by the researcher’s bias in the form of setting the problem statement and then choosing the research methodology and validation strategy. A research team itself introduces bias based on how positions in the team are advertised and the collective experience, interests, personalities and attitudes of the resulting research team. Biases are based on the inherent bounded rationality of the research team and express themselves in the form of limitations in the variety of conceptual systems that given researchers are able to think up. 
External triangulation is a label we have given to ways of trying to avoid bias and maintain consistency in and between the different stages of the theory construction process. The link between generalizability and our notions of empirical triangulation and theoretical triangulation is that these triangulations access new perspectives then check for consistency during the theory-building process, whereas generalization makes use of the theory that they build. 
The problem with exhorting researchers to systematically use external triangulation to check fit and reduce bias is that there is a limit to how many triangulation checks a researcher is able to do. This also produces a need to prioritize which in turn also generates a potential bias and thus potential opportunities for wrongly prioritizing some alternatives as well as missing others. Practically speaking, all that a researcher can do is to be aware of how the boundary of their experience affects their observation decisions and their research. This limitation is part of all inductive theory building (Ketokivi and Mantere, 2010). They can only try to be reasonably systematic and use prioritization techniques such as ‘theoretical saturation’ (Miles and Huberman, 1994) and triangulate using the perspectives of other stakeholders. Triangulation invokes a higher-level set of references, so the discussion has a context. But the limit on triangulation is that you lose your focus on the focal level by paying too much attention to the tacit level (Needham, 1988).
