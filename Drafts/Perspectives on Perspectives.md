The OU's style of teaching Systems Thinking is to be ambivalent about the suitability and appropriateness of specific approaches to specific contexts. Whilst this neutrality is important in the formulation of the Systems part (of Systems Thinking) it is less relevant, even damaging, in the Thinking part.

The initial framing - Interrelationships, Perspective and Boundaries - adopts a different significance and importance depending on the context and type of situation being considered. The analysts focus - the first amongst equals - needs to be refined according to the type of problem and the consequential nature of the solution and intervention.

In Critical Systems Thinking the aspects of perspectives and often the power politics are emphasised but this should not be to the exclusion of the Interrelationships and the Boundaries.

The academic literature focuses on the Boundary in terms of a Boundary Critique which is directed at the engagement of stakeholders. Equally Boundaries are important in the level of and understanding of the operation of hierarchical entities, for example natural systems, complex structures and organisations. The relationship between the primary functions of a business and the support activities, such as HR, is not solely about power but also about the structural coupling and levels of interaction. The Boundary is also the problem dimension through which recursion and transduction, the essential components of Cybernetics, are expressed.

> Theories consist of ‘what’—the variables, constructs and concepts that describe the subject of  interest; ‘how’—the ways that they relate to each other; and ‘why’—the underlying reasons for the existence of the ‘what’ and their relationships of ‘how’ (Whetten, 1989). ‘What and How describe; only Why explains.’ (ibid., p. 491). Explanation invokes a change in level. This invites Hierarchy Theory into the process. The change in level of analysis may be a reduction to the parts, in which case there is some ‘How’ in there. But if the change is to the level above, then there is only a ‘Why’ that invokes the significance of the system in context. (Allen)


> ‘Hierarchy theory’s method is to expand the problem space to include the observer as well as the observed’ (Ahl and Allen, 1996, p. 28). It enables the preconceptions, metaphors, values, interests, external theories and experience of the researcher to be examined as part of the research strategy. Hierarchy Theory addresses how ‘observation is the interface between perception and learning’ (ibid., p. 13). Observation, and research, require not just seeing but looking. Knowledge does not come from the observer and it does not come from the external world. Knowledge comes from an interaction of the two.  (Allen)


My take on this is that the boundary only comes into definition when we frame a situation is tied to a specific interest or focus, an outcome of this framing is the model. If we 'look away', that is are not observing the system, it does what it does, this might include operating as a series of models corresponding to a representation or transduction of the conditions under which it operates (the  liver cell operates with an abstracted form of the underlying thermodynamics, chemistry etc). 

The acid test here is to return to our primitive definitions of parts and wholes. In any reasonably complex system there are many levels of constituent sub-systems which we conceive as a part (perhaps a better definition of a part is an assembly devoid of emergent properties). The same phenomenon can be either an emergent part of a whole, or a property of a part - depending on the level of the observation.

This is what Tim Allen suggests when he writes - 

### What why and how

Theories consist of ‘what’—the variables, constructs and concepts that describe the subject of  interest; ‘how’—the ways that they relate to each other; and ‘why’—the underlying reasons for the existence of the ‘what’ and their relationships of ‘how’ (Whetten, 1989). ‘What and How describe; only Why explains.’ (ibid., p. 491). Explanation invokes a change in level. This invites Hierarchy Theory into the process. The change in level of analysis may be a reduction to the parts, in which case there is some ‘How’ in there. But if the change is to the level above, then there is only a ‘Why’ that invokes the significance of the system in context.

Remember the oft reference wave-particle duality is only of relevance when you attempt a measurement. If you 'look away' chemical substances continue to happily act as a collective in accord with a particulate understanding characterised by a probability wave.

The Smokey the Bear Metaphor is a plea for plurality in our thinking. It is very clear from the tragedy in the UK of the fire at Grenfell Tower, there are multiple 'causes' with the catastrophic conditions emerging from a toxic interplay of all of these factors - preventing any one factor could prevent the specific situation but acting together the hazardous situation emerges. The list of factors or causes include fraud by the cladding providers, failure of the EU building regulations circumventing the UK's BRE, failure to put out the initial fire, failure to re-think the evacuation order once the integrity of the building had been compromised ... together with any number of false memes introduced for political propaganda such as austerity.

[[Diversion: Beer Here and Now]]

The point is that on Grenfell, and in the coming discussions on the NHS, there are a plurality of causes which, working together, amplify original defects to catastrophic proportions. Yet the commentators and experts simply point the finger at one factor, usually a political scapegoat (for the NHS our politicos cite a botched re-organisation for the NHS and austerity - not the 2004 disastrous GP contract or the 1948 decisions on care). To fully understand how these factors requires a meshed plurality of thinking inter-twinned and spanning, up and down, across the levels and half-lives of the overall system and sub-systems. A recurrent theme developing across science is 'there are no privileged levels of causality' and the insight from any Systems Thinking requires the coherent dynamic mixing of causal factors. Most Systems Thinking appear limited to one-at-a-time plurality and a focus on consensus not co-existence.

Whether AI systems are capable of such rich, multi-conditional and multi-level conceptualisation is a moot point.

## Unbundling

The architecture extends the properties of the constituent elements beyond those natively present. Often architecture is directed at optimisation only. A more sustainable architecture and the best architectures are the ones with the widest tolerances for composition and the narrowest tolerances for performance. Often evolution is the progressive narrowing of tolerances from the control of the input tolerances (Deming etc) to the control of the output tolerance (Tainter)

In computer systems evolution as an example the role of the bios - the earliest binding - has evolved from the basic IO or the basis communication of the software to the hardware into the specificity of an operating system variant requiring near dedicated hardware. The legend was/is? that C is the uncommitted gateway between the functions of the hardware and functions of the software. Sadly the flexibility? of the chip is compromised by the demands of the software. Re-purposing
