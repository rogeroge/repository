The Purpose of a System is What It Does (POSIWID) (Beer)

Science is about what it is, design on the other hand is about what it ought to be (Ackoff)

Problem solving is what I have been trying to do all my adult life using whatever type of knowledge appeared accessible and relevant to me (Ackoff)

It is not unreasonable to suppose that these practitioners could succeed in influencing decision making regardless of the [OR] techniques they employed (Eden)

Managers are not confronted with problems that are independent of each other, but with dynamic situations that consist of complex systems of changing problems that interact with each other.(Ackoff)

 It is not that the incompressibility of complex systems prevents understanding, and that all methods that do not capture complexity to a complete extent are useless, but that we need to develop an awareness of how our methods limit our potential understanding of such systems (Richardson)

The Lindy Effect is the idea that the older something is, the longer it’s likely to be around in the future (Taleb)

Whenever I open the canon of Systems Thinking I fall into the trap of academic vanity. A simple idea is decorated with superfluous detail - which drags me into the rabbit hole of their (exhaustive) thinking on the topic. So much so I forget why I was interested in the first place. (James)

Fishing expeditions require a net (Denis Noble) 

While the Shannon equation is symbolically isomorphic with the Boltzmann equation, the meanings of the respective equations bear little in common (Wicken)

Another thing I have to reiterate: There is no answer to the question "Is your methodology any good?" Methodology is undecidable. If someone says to me: "I have used your SSM in this situation, and it’s absolutely terrific”, I have to say: "How do you know that some other approach wouldn’t have been even better in precisely that situation?" There is no answer to that. On the other hand, if people say "I've tried your SSM, and it’s no good, it doesn’t work", then I can reply (courteously, I hope): "How do you know it was not your incompetence in using it rather than the approach itself which is at fault?" (Checkland)

The central point is that a critical discussion and a comparison of various frameworks is always possible. It is just a dogma—a dangerous dogma—that the different frameworks are like mutually untranslatable languages . . . The Myth of the Framework is. in our time, the central bulwark of irrationalism. My counter thesis is that it simply exaggerates a difficulty into an impossibility. The difficulty of discussion between people brought up in different frameworks is to be admitted. But nothing is more fruitful than such a discussion. (Checkland)

A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it (Planck)

Who determines the problem, how the problem is solved, whether the problem has to be solved and what state the system will find itself in if it addresses the problem and tries to solve it? (Luhmann)

Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful (Box)
