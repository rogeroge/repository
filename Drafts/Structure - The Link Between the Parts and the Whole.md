For a while I have been intrigued by the schematic imagery used by McKelvey

In order to conceive transitions between these aspects of Complexity Science it is necessary to understand the axis of the graphic to answer the question "what changes"
Catastrophe Theory is recognised in thermodynamic systems as a Phase Transition or when multiple structures are equiprobable, it is the point at which there is a both thermodynamic and kinetic pathway between structurally dissimilar states. The attractor elements is when one structural element or motif is characteristic of the one state but not of the other, a specific part or part configuration becomes characteristic. Mathematically in Waddington's it is a saddle point in the Epigenetic Landscape
Fractals are characteristic in a physical system as scale free regularities, it is the characteristic of recursion where levels occur and where a sub-set of the properties of the whole are completely reproduced in the properties of the sub-assemblies. In one way it is the reverse of the strictly additive assumptions of 'the properties of the whole equals the properties of the parts'. It is also an example of [distinction of nature, common endpoint multiple paths] that there is a consistency of the whole but a variety of the parts (at least in some respects). It implies that a degeneracy and equivalence exists along the chosen axis of 'fractility' - typically aspects such as scale etc.
