In writing this to describe Systems Thinking I am reverting to a minimal and very simple view of Systems Thinking.

## Systems and Choice

The System part is embedded in the second order tradition or the realisation that when we talk about Systems we are not discussing a fixed and immutable entity but a product of the choice we, as individuals, make. The historians and philosophers labelled this as 2nd order or observer dependent. Whilst this points out the 'obvious' it is worth reminding ourselves that we have deliberately, if sometimes unconsciously, made arbitrary choices in defining the System.

Similarly you will not be far into a study of Systems Thinking before you encounter the distinction between [[Open and Closed systems]]. This is an important aspect of the possible properties of the 'System' but is one where choices are present and in which selections are made.

The choice also leads to the philosophical distinction between an [[ontological and epistemic]] view of the situation in which the System is pictured. It becomes the basis for so many of the categorisation approaches, such as the 2 by 2 matrix, that bedevils the subject. When we say known or unknown the distinction we are using is known by all to known by some - it is a division based on choice and based on the observer.

## Detail and Principles

In adopting a very simple definition of Systems Thinking - the framing of the situation by Systems and the predictions of behaviour through the perspectives of Thinking - we are leaping forward to learning about Systems Thinking as a set of principles not a catalogue of approaches. This makes the entry into the subject more difficult but the mastery of the subject far easier [[eb smith]]. It is the most expedient way to bring the gap between the rhetoric of Systems Thinking - "we need Systems Thinking" - and the practice as an improved understanding of the difficult situations we encounter.

## Simplicity

So much of our study of the world and our dealing of complexity is in pursuit of a sensemaking that we perceive as simplicity [[cut through not cut out]]. We require a clarity of thought in order to have confidence in our action.
