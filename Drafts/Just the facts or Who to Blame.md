Nice!

What you describe I recognise as a Rorschach (Ink Blot) test of the thinking stance of the reader. 

In complex multi-level systems there are multiple explanations pinned to a common mechanism (the events): for example you can see/blame crime on the victim, on the individual, on the system, on the government etc. It is a particular problem in climate change where the stance - the science is settled -- seeks to prohibit this natural process of level seeking.

The concept has been used as a parable: 
If I drop a weight whose fault is it - answer gravity
If I drop a weight and it falls on your head whose fault is it - answer me
If a drop a weight, you move and it falls on your head whose fault is it - answer you etc.

It is a great illustration of the critical practice of journalism - you first find the evidence and then compose the story (not the other way around!).
