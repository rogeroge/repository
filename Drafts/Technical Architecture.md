Like many others the Covid lockdown in 2020 gave me time and opportunity to 'think what I did when I was thinking'. I had become an avid reader of content through a mature adoption of RSS reading first with [TinyTinyRSS](https://tt-rss.org) and later [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/). This led to my reading, or at least skimming, many more sources and different thoughts. From around 2017 I also started to record what I had read, or what I considered saving, using [Wallabag](https://wallabag.org/). The key aspect of all of these tools was that they allowed self-hosting and open standards so that all of my embedded time, expressed as a collection of articles, would be retained in a system to which I have guaranteed access.

Up to 2020 I had dabbled with some of the tools which are today referred to as Personal Knowledge Management (PKM). I was an early adopted of Evernote, then dabbled with OneNote and finally Notion. Evernote peaked (around 2012) when it allowed cross-platform annotations but then retired the useful features became more costly and stopped development. OneNote was never easy and usually rather slow and finally with the mess over different versions and different licences. Notion arrived later on the scene had a nice UI and an practically inaccessible (too complex) programmable options, it again killed itself in my mind with the cost escalation.

Roam emerged briefly but was too expensive and too closed but with some interesting ideas and then finally came [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

Obsidian is the workhorse of my thinking but it is not the only tool I use. The limited cross-platform capability of Obsidian limits use to places where I can rely on a 'rich and thick' infrastructure such as a PC, Linux or Mac. On the mobile phone or an iPad it cannot be relied upon to be 100% compatible - issues with synchronisation or plug-in functionality remain. So in addition I use [UpNote](https://getupnote.com/) as the truly cross-platform and note taking application. UpNote is relatively simple, synchronises perfectly (so far!) and works speedily on anything at anytime. (I subscribed to UpNote premium to remove the restriction on the number of notes, encouragingly it offers a one time payment lifetime option). It allows a markdown export ready for Obsidian.

### Obsidian
Obsidian launched in 2020 largely around the promise of protecting 'your own' content in a readily transferable and storable format (MarkDown). After getting burnt before with my content that has been locked in, and destroyed, by other people's systems, this was a must.
As soon as you use Obsidian you come to realise the linking, transclusion, tagging and searching provide a wealth of different access to, and aspects of, your information. 

#### RSS
As described earlier my approach to coping with the torrent of information is as follows:

- **Miniflux** - provides the initial reading, selecting and sorting environment (approximately 4000 entries per day of which approximately 250 are skim read and 500 are reviewed by inspecting the title)
- **Wallabag** - provides an archive for the selected articles and webclipping (approximately 2000 articles per month selected over various topics). The Wallabag content is exported monthly as a JSON file for Obsidian
- **Obsidian** - is used to compose, edit, classify and link different article content




#### LinkedIn and Zettelkasten
Settling on the tool is an interesting diversion from the task of generating content. It is the generation process that is the more challenging and more worthwhile task.

The improvements to my reading environment (Miniflux/Wallabag/Obsidian) greatly improved the chaos of my bookmarks and the odd email or web post. However it did not greatly increase my output productivity - which remained as the odd word document or email draft.

What the Covid lockdown did however was to markedly increase my use of LinkedIn by virtue of thinking about things and joining in birds of a feather groups which of course replaced so many of the physical face-to-face events. Unwittingly therefore LinkedIn became a repository of those 'sidebar conversation' I had held on topics of interests (which notably included the topic of this piece - Systems Thinking). The interest in PKM made the linkage to the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/) approach and so peaked my curiosity that perhaps the entirety of my LinkedIn catalogue was a form of Zettel (indeed my suspicious nature worried that some of the trolls on LinkedIn were harvesting other peoples responses to their outrageous posts to generate content).

One of the essential Obsidian plug-ins is the [JSON/CSV Importer](https://github.com/farling42/obsidian-import-json) which together with the facility in LinkedIn to [export all of your content](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339364/downloading-your-account-data). 

**Voila!** What used to be a mess of awk scripts, of my own making, is now an automated process.

> #### A Story about Futzing
> One of the formative experiences of my life was the executive education series from [[CSC Vanguard]]. From launch [Douglas Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams) was a keen attendee. Notably in 1992, or so, I had dinner in the Science Museum with Douglas and [Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay), our topic of conversation was creativity. Douglas famous as the author of The HitchHikers Guide to the Galaxy described his process and how futzing around with his Mac had replaced his taking a bath when he was suffering from writers block. The thing he liked about the Mac, compared to the PCs of the time, was that you could spend a few minutes or hours messing with things but the system never broke.
> Obsidian is similar in that it allows an amount of uncritical messing around with content as the necessary therapy and break from the more arduous task of generating new content.
