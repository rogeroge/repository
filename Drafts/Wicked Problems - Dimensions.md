**Proposition 1** There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem.
**Proposition 2** Wicked problems have no stopping rule.
**Proposition 3** Solutions to wicked problems are not true-or-false, but good-or-bad.
**Proposition 4** There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem.
**Proposition 5** Every solution to a wicked problem is a ‘one-shot operation’; because there is no opportunity to learn by trial-and-error, every attempt counts significantly.
**Proposition 6** Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or exhaustively desirable) set of potential solutions, nor is there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan.
**Proposition 7** Every wicked problem is essentially unique.
**Proposition 8** Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem.
**Proposition 9** The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways. The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem’s resolution.
**Proposition 10** The planner has no right to be wrong.

He saw the key achievements of their 1973 paper as **ontological** for identifying the existence of wicked problems, **epistemological** for challenging our ability to understand them, and **ethical** for questioning our ability to act rightly in relation to them
