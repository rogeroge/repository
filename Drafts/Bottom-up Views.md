In the spirit of requisite variety when we try and describe the principles of Systems Thinking, complexity etc we should employ a media with, at least, the same variety as the topic we are discussing. 

## Middle Numbers

We make reference to Weinberg's [[Middle Number concepts]] we focus our attention on a zone of a system properties which exhibit interesting and changeable behaviours. It is, as described by Pattee/Allen, a zone delineated by a set of immutable laws at a detailed level and a number of assumptions or constraints at the environment level. [[Ashby's distinction]] notably called the first variables and the latter parameters.

In structuring this resource on Systems Thinking and delivering it in this Obsidian form it allows us to access the principles and concepts bottom-up as well as top-down. In the traditional printed form the top-down and bottom-up perspectives are very different and form and consequently in function - typically the table of contents and the choice of chapter/section layout are the top-down access to the information and the index view provides the bottom-up access. Traditionally there is an asymmetry in this approach with the top down view favoured by way of coherence and flow.

Even the web has such an intrinsic asymmetry and whereas the pioneer hypertext systems embedded both forward and backward links the mass development of the web downgraded the capability of the backward link. The requisite dialectic in sensemaking of the yin and yan, convergence and divergence, synthesis and analysis etc require an equal treatment of the poles of thought and a symmetry in the movement from one to the other in any direction. Interesting tools such as [[Hyperknowledge]] and Beer's [[yo-yo model]] embed this ability.

In recognising the importance of the [[Middle Number concepts]] we seek to construct possibilities by manipulating the situation such that emergent behaviours are developed and shaped. This facility is enabled by shaping of the detail, composition and [[structure]] of the Systems components.
